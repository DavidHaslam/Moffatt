### The Moffat Bible

A project for turning the [Moffat Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffatt,_New_Translation) into an eBook for [Project Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and others.


The complete Moffatt Bible was published by the **George H. Doran Company** in 1922, so the work is now in the **Public Domain**.
