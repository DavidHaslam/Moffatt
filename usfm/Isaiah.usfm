\mt1 ISAIAH
\c 1
\p
\v 1 IThe revelations about Judah and Jerusalem which were made to Isaiah the son of Amoz during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\v 2
\q1 “Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth”--
\q2 is the Eternal speaking--
\q1 I have reared, have brought up sons,
\q2 and they have rebelled against me;
\v 3
\q1 a bullock knows its owner
\q2 an ass its master’s manger
\q1 but Israel does not care
\q2 my people never heeds me.”
\v 4
\q1 Ah sinful nation,
\q2 folk whose guilt is heavy
\q1 ah race of wrongdoers
\q2 sons degenerate-
\q1 they have abandoned the Eternal,
\q2 and spurned the Majesty of Israel!
\v 5
\q1 Why will you earn fresh strokes
\q2 for holding on in your revolt?
\q1 Your whole head is sick
\q2 your whole heart is diseased;
\v 6
\q1 from the sole of the foot to the head,
\q2 no part is sound
\q1 nothing but bruises and gashes
\q2 and raw, bleeding wounds
\q1 unsqueezed, unbandaged
\q2 unsoftened with oil.
\v 7
\q1 Your land lies desolate
\q2 your towns are binned
\q1 and foreigners ravage your soi
\q2 under your very eyes:
\v 8
\q1 Maiden Sion is left all alone
\q2 like a booth inside a vineyard
\q1 a shed in a cucumber field
\q2 a city beleaguered.
\v 9
\q1 Had not the Lord of host
\q2 left us a few to survive,
\q1 we should have fared like Sodom
\q2 no better than Gomorrah.
\p
\v 10
\q1 Listen to the Eternal’s word
\q2 you ‘Sodom’ of authorities
\q1 Listen to our God’s directions
\q2 you ‘Gomorrah’ of citizens!
\v 11
\q1 “What care I for all your lavish sacrifices?
\q2 the Eternal asks;
\q1 “I am sick of slaughtered rams
\q2 of fat from fatted beasts
\q1 the blood of bullocks and of goats
\q2 is no delight to me.
\v 12
\q1 Who asked that from you,
\q2 when you gather in my presence?
\q1 Crowd my courts no more
\v 13
\q2 bring offerings no more;
\q1 the smoke of sacrifice is vain,
\q2 I loathe it;
\v 14
\q1 your gatherings at the new mooand on sabbath,
\q2 I cannot abide them
\q1 your fasts and festivals
\q2 my soul abhors them
\q1 they are a weariness to me,
\q2 I am tired of them.
\v 15
\q1 You may stretch out your hands,
\q2 but I will never look at you,
\q1 and though you offer many a prayer,
\q2 I will not listen.
\q1 Your hands are full of bloodshed;
\v 16
\q2 wash yourselves clean,
\q1 banish your evil doing
\q2 from my sight
\q1 cease to do wrong,
\v 17
\q2 learn to do right,
\q1 make justice all your aim
\q2 and put a check on violence,
\q1 let orphans have their rights
\q2 uphold the widow’s cause.
\v 18
\q1 Come, let me put it thus,
\q2 the Eternal argues:
\q1 scarlet your sins may be
\q2 but they can become white as snow,
\q1 they may be red as crimson
\q2 and yet turn white as wool.
\v 19
\q1 If only you are willing to obey,
\q2 you shall feed on the best of the land;
\v 20
\q1 but if you decline and defy me,
\q2 then husks shall be your food--
\q1 so the Eternal himself decrees.”
\p
\v 21
\q2 How unfaithful she has turned,
\q2 the city once so true and trusty!
\q1 Sion once so full of justice
\q1 once the seat of right
\q2 and now a haunt of murderers!
\v 22
\q1 Your silver, it has turned to dross,
\q2 your wine is spoiled with water;
\v 23
\q1 your rulers are unruly men,
\q2 hand in hand with thieves
\q1 every one fond of his bribe
\q2 keen upon fees,
\q1 but careless of the orphan’s rights,
\q2 and of the widow’s cause.
\p
\v 24
\q1 This therefore is the sentence of the Lord,
\q2 the Lord of hosts, Hero of Israel:
\q1 “Ha! I will have the comfort of vengeance on my foes
\q2 on folk who dare resist me!
\v 25
\q1 I will turn my hand against you,
\q2 smelt your dross out in a furnace,
\q2 and clear out all your alloy;
\v 26
\q1 I will give you governors as at first,
\q2 and councillors as at the start
\q1 and then a ‘citadel of justice’ shall you be
\q2 a true and trusty City.
\v 27
\q1 Justice will be the saving of Sion,
\q2 an honest life will save;
\v 28
\q1 but rebels and sinners shall be crushed together
\q2 those who abandon the Eternal shall be doomed.
\v 29
\q1 The sacred trees you love shall disappoint you
\q2 you will blush for groves so dear now to your rites;
\v 30
\q1 for you shall wither like a tree
\q2 like a garden without water.
\v 31
\q1 Strong men shall become like tow,
\q2 their idols like a spark;
\q1 they shall burn up togethe
\q2 in a blaze that none can quench.”
\c 2
\p
\v 1 The word of Isaiah the son ey of Amoz--his vision of Judah, of Jerusalem.
\v 2 In after days it shall be that the Eternal’s hill shall rise, towering over every hill, and higher than the heights.
\q1 To it shall all the nations stream,
\v 3
\q1 and many a folk exclaim,
\q1 “Come, let us go to the Eternal’s hill,
\q1 to the house of Jacob’s God
\q1 that he may instruct us in his ways,
\q1 to walk upon his paths.”
\q1 For instruction comes from Sion,
\q2 and from Jerusalem the Eternal’s word.
\v 4
\q1 He will decide the disputes of the nations,
\q1 and settle many a people’s case
\q1 till swords are beaten into ploughshares
\q2 spears into pruning-hooks
\q2 no nation draws the sword against another
\q1 no longer shall men learn to fight.
\v 5
\q1 O household of Jacob, come,
\q2 let us live by the light of the Eternal!
    * * *
\v 10
\q1 Get into caves of the rocks
\q2 hide in holes of the ground
\q1 away from the terror of the Eternal,
\q2 from his dread majesty.
\v 6
\q1 For he has abandoned his people,
\q2 the household of Jacob
\q1 their land so full of traders
\q2 of bargains with the foreigner,
\v 7
\q1 their land so full of silver and of gold,
\q2 no end to their stores
\q1 their land so full of horses
\q2 no end to their war-chariots,
\v 8
\q1 their land so full of idols,
\q2 no end to their images-
\q1 they worship what their own hands make,
\q2 things their own fingers fashion!
\v 9
\q1 But human pride shall be laid low,
\q2 man’s haughtiness shall be humbled;
\v 11
\q1 the Eternal shall alone be exalted,
\q2 when he rises to overawe the earth.
\v 10
\q1 Get into caves of the rocks,
\q2 hide in holes of the ground
\q1 away from the terror of the Eternal,
\q2 from his dread majesty.
\v 12
\q1 For the Lord of hosts has a day of doom
\q2 on all that is proud and haughty,
\q2 on all that is lofty and soaring,
\v 13
\q1 on all cedars of Lebanon,
\q2 on all oaks of Bashan,
\v 14
\q1 on all lofty mountains,
\q2 on all towering hills,
\v 15
\q1 on every high tower,
\q2 on every rampart of a fort,
\v 16
\q1 on all the deep-sea ships,
\q2 on every gallant craft;
\v 17
\q1 then human pride shall be laid low,
\q2 man’s haughtiness shall be humbled;
\q1 the Eternal shall alone be exalted,
\v 18
\q2 but idols one and all shall vanish.
\p
\v 19
\q1 Get into caves of the rocks
\q2 hide in holes of the ground
\q1 away from the terror of the Eternal,
\q2 from his dread majest
\q2 when he rises to overawe the earth.
\v 20
\q1 Then man shall fling
\q2 to rats and bat
\q1 his silver and his golden idols
\q2 that he made for worship,
\v 21
\q1 and get into caves of the rocks
\q2 into crevices of cliffs
\q1 to hide from the terror of the Eternal,
\q2 from his dread majest
\q2 when he rises to overawe the earth.
\v 22
\q1 [[Put no more trust in man, with his mere breath of life:
\q2 of what account is he?]]
    * * *
\c 3
\p
\v 1
\q1 Here is the Lord,
\q2 the Lord of hosts
\q1 removing every prop and sta
\q2 from Judah and Jerusalem
\v 2
\q1 soldier and warrior
\q2 governor and prophet,
\v 3
\q1 seer, sheikh, and official,
\q2 authorities and councillors
\q2 expert magicians and enchanters.
\v 4
\q1 “I will make mere lads their leaders,
\q2 and leave them to be swayed by whims;
\v 5
\q1 tyranny between man and man
\q2 between very neighbours
\q1 insolence from young to old
\q2 from low to high;
\v 6
\q1 men shall seize a clansman, crying,
\q2 ‘Your house has a robe of office;
\q1 come, be our chieftain, then
\q2 master this chaos!’
\v 7
\q1 But he will make protest,
\q2 ‘No, I can be no good to you
\q1 my own house has no food
\q2 no robe of office
\q1 you shall not put me up to b
\q2 a headman of the people.’
\p
\v 8
\q1 No, ruined is Jerusalem
\q2 and Judah is to fall
\q1 they challenge the Eternal with their words and deeds
\q2 defying his glorious eyes;
\v 9
\q1 their insolence condemns them,
\q2 they flaunt their sin like Sodom.
\q1 'Woe, woe to them, for they have wrought
\q2 their own undoing!
\v 10
\q1 Well for the just man, he fares well,
\q2 he reaps the good of all that he has done!
\v 11
\q1 Woe to the villain, he fares ill
\q2 undone by all that he has done!
\v 12
\q1 My people’s ruler is a wilful child,
\q2 they are controlled by women;
\q1 your leaders are misleading you, my people,
\q2 they are effacing the true path for you.”
\p
\v 13
\q1 Now the Eternal holds assizes,
\q2 to arraign his people the Eternal rises,
\v 14
\q1 summoning before him to the bar
\q2 the sheikhs and rulers of his people:
\q1 “So you have stripped my vineyard bare?
\q2 You hoard what you have plundered from the poor?
\v 15
\q1 What mean you by crushing my people,
\q2 and grinding the face of the poor?”
\q2 So the Lord asks, the Lord of hosts.
\v 16
\q1 The Eternal also said:
\q1 Since they are so haughty
\q2 the daughters of Sion
\q1 holding their heads high as they walk,
\q2 and ogling with their eyes
\q1 walking with their mincing steps,
\q2 their anklets jingling,
\v 17
\q1 the Lord will strike their heads with scabs,
\q2 the Eternal will strip them bare.
\v 18 [[On that day the Lord will deprive them of their finery, of anklets, tiaras, necklaces,
\v 19 earrings, bracelets and veils,
\v 20 headbands, armlets, and sashes, scent-bottles, charms,
\v 21 signet-rings and nose-rings,
\v 22 robes of state, mantles, shawls and purses,
\v 23 gauze, linen turbans, and wrappers.]]
\v 24
\q1 For scent they shall hav
\q2 stenches, ropes for girdles
\q1 baldness in place of curls
\q2 sackcloth instead of silk
\q2 the brand of slavery instead of beauty.
\v 25
\q1 [[The sword shall cut your liege-men down,
\q2 your heroes in the fray;
\v 26
\q1 the city-gates shall wail, all woe- begone,
\q2 the city sit forlorn.]]
\c 4
\p
\v 1
\q1 Seven women on that da
\q2 shall catch hold of a single man,
\q1 crying, “We will earn our living
\q2 we will clothe ourselves
\q1 but only let us bear your name
\q2 to save us from disgrace!”
    * * *
\v 2
\q1 Then fair and fine shall the green growth be,
\q2 and a proud crown shall the field-crops be.
\q2 for the Israelites who are spared;
\v 3
\q1 the survivors in Sion,
\q2 and those left in Jerusalem
\q1 all who are entered in the book of Life,
\q2 they shall be held sacred,
\v 4
\q1 when the Lord has washed away
\q2 the filth from Sion
\q1 and rinsed Jerusale
\q2 from bloodstains
\q1 by a blast of doom
\q2 a devastating blast.
\v 5
\q1 Then shading all mount Sion
\q2 the Eternal himself will for
\q2 a cloud during the day-time
\q1 and spread o’er all the gatherings there
\q2 a canopy of brilliant light
\q2 a fire within the night,
\v 6
\q1 to shade them from the scorching heat,
\q2 and safely shelter them from storm and sleet.
    * * *

\p
\v 1
\q1 Let me sing of my Friend, sing a love-song of his vineyard:
\q1 My Friend, he had a vineyard, on a fruitful slope:
\v 2
\q1 he dug it, cleared the stones away,
\q2 he planted the pick of the vines,
\q1 in it he built a watch-tower
\q2 and had a winepress hewn
\q1 then he looked for good grapes,
\q2 and it bore him--wild grapes!
\v 3
\q1 “Now, dwellers in Jerusalem
\q2 now, men of Judah
\q1 pray judge between m
\q2 and my vineyard.
\v 4
\q1 What more could have been done for it?
\q2 What have I left undone?
\q1 And when I looked for good grapes,
\q2 why did it bear wild grapes?
\v 5
\q1 Let me tell you now
\q2 what I will do to this my vineyard--
\q1 tear it down till it is ruined
\q2 break the wall down till it lies trampled.
\v 6
\q1 I’ll make an end of it;
\q2 unpruned, unweeded
\q1 it shall be overgrown with thorns and thistles
\q2 and I will bid the clouds drop no rain on it.”
\p
\v 7
\q1 The Eternal’s vineyard is the house of Israel
\q2 the men of Judah are his dear plantation:
\q1 he looked for justice--and lo, bloodshed!
\q2 for right--and lo, shrieks from the wronged!
    * * *
\v 8
\q1 Woe to men who add house to house,
\q2 who join one field to another
\q1 till there is room for none but them
\q2 in all the land!
\v 9
\q1 The Lord of hosts has sworn to me,
\q1 “Many a mansion is to lie forlorn,
\q1 splendid and spacious and--empty!
\v 10
\q1 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but eight gallons
\q1 and the harvest shall only be a tenth of what is sown.”
\p
\v 11
\q1 Woe to those who get up early
\q2 for a drinking bout
\q1 who sit far into the night
\q2 heated by their wine,
\v 12
\q1 revellers with lyre and lute
\q2 with tambourine and flute!
\q1 They heed not what the Eternal has in hand,
\q2 they never see what he is doing.
\v 13
\q1 So shall my people suddenly pass into exile,
\q1 their leaders famishing with hunger,
\q2 the masses parched with thirst.
\v 14
\q1 So the underworld gapes greedily,
\q2 opening its jaws ever so wide
\q1 and down go Sion’s pomp and throng,
\q2 down go all her madding crowd!
\v 17
\q1 Lambs graze in the deserted scenes,
\q2 kids feed among the ruins
\v 15
\q1 [[and man is abased,
\q2 mortals are brought low
\q2 the haughty eyes are downcast,
\v 16
\q1 but the Lord of hosts is exalted by his judgment;
\q2 God’s sentence shows His Majesty is living]].
\v 18
\q1 Woe to those who draw guilt on themselves
\q2 by stout ungodliness, as with a rope,
\q1 and drag the penalty of sin upon them,
\q2 harnessing themselves to it!--
\v 19
\q1 who sneer, “Pray let us see what he will do!
\q2 Let him make haste!
\q1 We’d like to know what Israel’s Majesty
\q2 can have in mind!”
\v 20
\q1 Woe to those who call good evil,
\q2 and call evil good
\q1 who make out darkness to be light,
\q2 light to be darkness
\q1 who make out bitter to be sweet
\q2 sweet to be bitter!
\p
\v 21
\q1 Woe to those who think themselves so wise
\q2 fancy themselves shrewd!
\v 16
\q1 Woe to those who are brave--at drinking!
\q2 mighty at--mixing a bowl!
\v 23
\q1 who let off guilty men for a bribe,
\q2 and deprive the innocent of his rights!
\v 24
\q1 As a tongue of fire licks up the stubble,
\q2 as hay is shrivelled in the flames,
\q1 their root shall rot,
\q2 their blossoms moulder
\q1 for scorning orders from the Lord of hosts,
\q2 for spurning what Israel’s Majesty decreed.
    * * *

\p
\v 1
\q1 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; his trailing robes spread over the temple-floor,
\v 2 and seraphs hovered round him, each with six wings—two covering the face, two covering the body, and two to fly with.
\v 3 They kept calling to one another,
\q1 “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts,
\q2 his majestic splendour fills the whole earth!”
\v 4 At the sound of the chant, the foundations of the threshold shook, and the temple began to fill with smoke.
\v 5 Then I said, “Alas! I am undone! man of unclean lips that I am, living among a people of unclean lips!
\v 6 I am undone, for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!” But one of the seraphs flew towards me with a live coal in his hand, which he had lifted with tongs from the altar;
\v 7 he touched my mouth with it, saying,
\q1 “Now that this has touched your lips,
\q2 your guilt is gone, your sin forgiven.”
\v 8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying,
\q1 “Whom shall I send?
\q1 Who will go for us?”
I answered, “Here am I; send me.”
\v 9 Then he said, “Go and tell this people:
\q1 ‘Listen and listen--but never understand!
\q2 Look and look--but never see!’
\v 10
\q1 Make the mind of this people dull,
\q2 make their ears heavy and close up their eyes
\q1 lest their eyes see, lest their ears hear,
\q2 lest their minds understand, and their health be restored.”
\p
\v 11 “Lord,” I asked, “for how long?” He answered,
\q1 “Till they are ruined
\q1 till their towns are empty
\q1 and their houses uninhabited
\q1 and the land left desolate;
\v 12
\q1 till the Eternal banishes the folk afar,
\q2 and wide tracts of the land lie bare:
\v 13
\q1 even if a tenth of them be spared
\q1 they too must be burned up
\q1 like stumps of oak and terebint
\q1 that have been felled
\q1 [[these stumps are the sacred race]].”
\c 7
\p
\v 1 During the reign of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, marched up to attack Jerusalem (though they could not deliver their attack).
\v 2 When news came to the royal court that the Aramaeans had occupied Ephraim, the heart of Ahaz and of his people quivered like trees quivering before the wind in the jungle.
\v 3 But the Eternal said to Isaiah, “Go out, with your son Shear-yashub, to meet Ahaz at the top of the conduit from the upper reservoir, on the road to Fuller’s Field.
\v 4 Tell him, he must be calm, never quail, never be afraid of these two fag-ends of flickering torches, of Rezin and the son of Remaliah with their blazing fury.
\v 5 Aram and Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have planned mischief against you,
\v 6 thinking to invade Judah and reduce it to straits, to break in and seize it and set Tabeal’s son upon the throne;
\v 7 but this is what the Lord the Eternal says:
\q1 ‘Their plan shall fail,
\q2 this shall not be;
\v 8
\q1 Damascus is but the capital of Aram,
\q2 and only in Damascus Rezin rules
\q1 [[within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be so shattered that it ceases to be a nation]],
\v 9
\q1 Samaria is but the capital of Ephraim,
\q2 and only in Samaria rules Remaliah’s son.
\q1 If your faith does not hold
\q2 you will never hold out.’ ”
\v 10 I also said to Ahaz,
\v 11 “Ask the Eternal your God for an omen--from the deep underworld or from high heaven.”
\v 12 “No,” said Ahaz, “I will not put the Eternal to any test.”
\v 13 Then I said, “Listen, you royalties, I am tired of you! And will you insist on tiring my God as well as a man like myself? An omen you shall have, and that from the Eternal himself.
\v 14 There is a young woman with child, who shall bear a son and call his name ‘Immanuel’ (God is with us);
\v 15 [[he shall enjoy curds and honey, whenever he knows good food from bad]],
\v 16 for before ever the child knows good food from bad, the land whose two kings are your terror shall be desolate.”
* * *
\v 17
\q1 The Eternal will bring upon you,
\q2 on your people and your family,
\q1 a time such as never has been
\q2 since Ephraim broke with Judah.
\v 18
\q1 For then it shall be
\q2 that the Eternal whistles for fly and bee,
\v 19
\q1 for foes that swarm and settle all
\q2 in the steep ravines and crevices of cliffs,
\q2 on every bush and pasture- land.
\v 20
\q1 Then, with a razor hired [[the Assyrian king]]
\q2 from the banks of the Euphrates,
\q1 will the Eternal shave your country bare
\q2 shaving off every hair
\q2 lopping the very beard away.
\v 21
\q1 Then a man can only keep
\q2 a single cow and a couple of sheep,
\v 22
\q1 though the ample milk
\q2 will supply him with curds
\q1 for any survivors in the lan
\q2 shall only fare on curds and honey.
\v 23
\q1 Then it shall be that every spot,
\q2 once rich with a thousand vines,
\q1 worth a thousand silver pieces
\q2 shall be all thorns and thistles;
\v 24
\q1 and men will go hunting with arrow and bow
\q2 for all the country is thorns and thistles;
\v 25
\q1 and if you went to slopes once hoed,
\q2 you would see only thorns and thistles,
\q2 a cattle-run and a sheep-walk.
 * * *
\c 8
\p
\v 1 The Eternal said to me, “Take a large board and write on it plainly, ‘Spoilsoonprey--quick,’
\v 2 and have it attested by two reliable witnesses, by Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.”
\v 3 Then I the prophet went to my wife, and, when she had conceived and borne a son, the Eternal said to me, “Name him ‘Spoil- soonpreyquick.’
\v 4 For before the boy knows how to say, ‘my father’ and ‘my mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria shall be carried off to the king of Assyria.”
\p
\v 5 Once again the Eternal said to me:
\v 6
\q1 Since this people has rejected
\q2 the soft flow from Shiloah
\q1 and since they are dejecte
\q2 over Rezin and Remaliah’s son,
\v 7
\q1 therefore the Lord lets loose on them
\q2 the strong, full surge of the Euphrates
\q2 [[the king of Assyria and all his array]],
\q1 overflowing all its channels,
\q2 brimming over all its banks,
\v 8
\q1 swirling onwards, flooding Judah,
\q2 flooding it up to the neck.
\q1 But the Lord’s wings outstretched
\q2 shall cover the country from side to side
\q2 for “God is with us.”
\v 9
\q1 Rage away, you nations--
\q2 only to be shattered!
\q1 (listen to this, all lands afar!)
\q1 Arm for the fray
\q2 and you shall be shattered!
\q1 Arm for the fray
\q2 and you shall be shattered!
\v 10
\q1 Form your plot,
\q2 and it shall fail
\q1 lay your plan
\q2 it never shall prevail
\q2 for “God is with us.”
\v 11 Here is what the Eternal said to me, with overwhelming force, as he warned me not to take the line of this people:
\v 12
\q1 “Do not call out ‘Danger!’
\q2 when this people calls out ‘Danger!’
\q1 Have no fear of what they fear
\q2 never dread it.
\v 13
\q1 The danger lies with the Lord of hosts;
\q2 ’tis he whom you should fear
\q2 ’tis he whom you should dread!
\v 14
\q1 Over him, like a stone in the road,
\q2 both houses of Israel shall trip and tumble;
\q2 to the Jerusalemites he is a trap and snare--
\v 15
\q1 many shall trip and fall with a crash,
\q2 many shall be caught and captured.”
\v 16 I will seal up my message, and commit my counsel to the safe keeping of my pupils;
\v 17 then I will wait on for the Eternal who now hides his face from the house of Israel,
\v 18 I will hope for him. I and the two children whom the Eternal has given me are omens and portents set in Israel by the Lord of hosts, who dwells on Sion hill.
\p
\v 19 When they tell you to consult mediums and ghosts that cheep and gibber in low murmurs, ask them if a nation should not rather consult its God. Say, “Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
\v 20 Consult the Message and the Counsel of God!” But that will only be their cry, when there is no dawn of hope for them any more.
\v 21
\q1 They shall roam through the land, hard pressed and hungry,
\q2 hunger driving them to rage
\q2 till they curse their King and God;
\q1 they shall gaze up to heaven,

\q2 and look round upon earth,
\q1 only to see distress and darkness,
\q2 anguish and utter gloom--
\q2 poor waifs of men!

\v 1 Formerly he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but now he has honoured the region of Galilee’s sea, the district that the nations hold west of the Jordan.
\v 2
\q1 The people who were dwelling in the darknes
\q2 have now seen a great light
\q1 those who were living in a land of shadows,
\q2 upon them light has shone.
\v 3
\q1 Thou hast richly given them gladness,
\q2 and an ample joy
\q1 in thy presence they rejoice like harvesters,
\q2 as men rejoice dividing plunder.
\p
\v 4
\q1 For thou hast broken their heavy yoke,
\q2 the bar that bent their shoulders,
\q1 and the whip of their oppressors
\q2 as at the triumph over Midian;
\v 5
\q1 the stamping warrior’s boot
\q2 the bloodstained war-attire
\q1 shall all of them be burnt
\q2 as fuel for the fire.
\p
\v 6
\q1 For a child has been born to us
\q2 a son has been given to us
\q1 the royal dignity he wears
\q2 and this the title that he bears--
\q1 “A wonder of a counsellor
\q2 a divine hero
\q1 a father for all time
\q2 a peaceful prince!”
\v 7
\q1 Great is his authority,
\q2 endless is his peace
\q1 over David’s thron
\q2 and his dominion,
\q1 to base it firm and stabl
\q2 on justice and good order
\q1 from henceforth and for ever-
\q2 thanks to the jealous care of the Eternal.

\v 8
\q1 The Lord’s word, sent for Jacob,
\q2 shall drop on Israel,
\v 9
\q1 till all the people feel its weight
\q2 in Ephraim and Samaria.
\q1 For in their pride and arroganc
\q2 they vaunt aloud,
\v 10
\q1 “The bricks have broken down
\q2 but we will build up masonry
\q1 the sycomore-work is gone
\q2 but in its place we will put cedar-work.”
\v 11
\q1 So the Eternal stirs their foes against them,
\q2 he has spurred on their enemies;
\v 12
\q1 Aramaeans east and Philistines west
\q2 gulp Israel down.
\q1 And yet his wrath is not abated
\q2 his arm is stretched out still to strike.
\p
\v 13
\q1 The people would not turn to him who struck them
\q2 they would not seek the Lord of hosts;
\v 14
\q1 so he lopped off head and tail,
\q2 palm-branch and rush in a single day
\v 15
\q1 [[the sheikhs and authorities are the “head,”
\q2 the prophets with false oracles are the “tail”;
\v 16
\q1 the leaders of this people mislead them,
\q2 and those who are led are lost]].
\v 17
\q1 So the Lord spares not their soldiers,
\q2 pitiless even to orphans and widows;
\q1 for they are all profane and wicked,
\q2 impiety is on every lip.
\q1 And yet his wrath is not abated,
\q2 his arm is stretched out still to strike.
\p
\v 18
\q1 Ungodliness blazed like a fire
\q2 consuming thorns and briars,
\q1 and firing thickets in the forest
\q2 till the smoke rolled up in clouds.
\v 19
\q1 The fury of the Eternal burned the land,
\q2 till the folk preyed upon each other;
\v 20
\q1 they snatched to right and still were hungry,
\q2 they munched to left and were not satisfied;
\q1 none had pity for his fellow
\q2 each gnawed at his neighbour;
\v 21
\q1 Manasseh tore at Ephraim and Ephraim at Manasseh
\q2 and both together tore at Judah.
\q1 And yet his wrath is not abated
\q2 his arm is stretched out still to strike.
\c
\p
\v 1
\q1 Woe to those who issue a harsh decrees,
\q2 penning orders that oppress,
\v 2
\q1 robbing the weak of their rights
\q2 and defrauding the poor of their dues,
\q1 till widows fall to them as spoil
\q2 and orphans as their prey.
\v 3
\q1 What will you do at the great Assize,
\q2 when the storm blows from abroad?
\q1 To whom will you run then for help,
\q2 and where will you put your plunder?
\v 4
\q1 Yours only to crouch low among the captives,
\q2 or fall under the corpses of the slain.
\q1 And yet his wrath is not abated
\q2 his arm is stretched out still to strike.
\c 5
\p
\v 25
\q1 So the Eternal’s anger blazes against his people,
\q2 he stretches out his arm against them,
\q1 striking them till the mountains tremble,
\q2 and corpses lie like dung upon the streets.
\q1 And yet his wrath is not abated,
\q2 his arm is stretched out still to strike.
\v 26
\q1 He signals to a foreign power,
\q2 whistling for them from the end of the earth
\q1 swiftly they come, speedily,
\v 27
\q2 none tired, none tripping
\q1 not a belt slack,
\q2 not a shoe-string broken,
\v 28
\q1 arrows sharpened,
\q2 bows all bent,
\q1 horses’ hoofs as hard as flint
\q2 chariot wheels like whirlwinds--
\v 29
\q1 growling like a lion,
\q2 growling like young lions
\q1 gripping their victim with a growl,
\q2 bearing it oil, with none to rescue.
\c 10
\p
\v 5
\q1 I A Woe betide this Assyria!
\q2 He is my club in anger
\q2 the rod I wield in wrath;
\v 6
\q1 I speed him against an impious nation,
\q2 a people with whom I am wroth,
\q1 bidding him plunder and spoil them,
\q2 trample them down like mud in the street.
\v 7
\q1 But other plans has he
\q2 and other aims!
\q1 His thought is to exterminate
\q2 the nations far and wide.
\v 8
\q1 “Are not my very captains as good as kings?” says he;
\v 9
\q2 “Has not Kalno fared like Karkemish,
\q1 Hamath like Arpad,
\q2 Samaria like Damascus?
\v 10
\q1 [[As I have gripped these empires of idols,
\q2 idols more than Jerusalem’s
\v 11
\q1 can I not treat Jerusalem and its images
\q2 even as Samaria and its idols?”
\v 12 So when the Eternal has completed what he has to do on Sion hill and in Jerusalem, he will punish the audacious vaunting of the king of Assyria and the arrogance of his pride for saying]]
\v 13
\q1 My strong hand did it all
\q2 my clever strategy;
\q1 I shifted the boundaries of nations,
\q2 I plundered their treasures,
\q1 I reduced them to ashes
\q2 and felled their folk like a bullock;
\v 14
\q1 the wealth of nations, I rifled it all,
\q2 like the nest of a bird,
\q1 I ransacked the wide worl
\q2 as a man who gathers eggs
\q1 till not a wing fluttered
\q2 none dared cheep or chirp.”
\p
\v 15
\q1 Is the axe to boast over the woodman?
\q2 Is the saw to decry the sawyer?
\q1 ’Twould be like a club swinging him who lifted it
\q2 a staff brandishing a man!
\v 16
\q1 So the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will send
\q2 a wasting disease on his flourishing frame,
\q1 and under his glitter a burning heat
\q2 that glows like a flame,
\v 18
\q1 consuming him soul and body
\q2 till he pines away like a man diseased.
\v 17
\q1 He who is light to Israel shall be a fire,
\q2 His Majesty shall blaze like flame,
\q1 devouring thorns and briars,
\q2 the splendid woods and gardens;
\v 19
\q1 and any trees left there shall be so few
\q2 that a mere child can count them.
\v 24 This, then, is what the Lord, the Lord of hosts, declares: O my people, who reside in Sion, never fear Assyria, though he strikes you with his club, lifting the rod against you as did Egypt long ago;
\v 25 for very soon my fierce anger against you shall be spent, and my wrath shall come to an end.
\v 26 The Lord of hosts will swing the lash over Assyria, as when Midian was crushed at Ravensrock; he will raise the rod again that once he raised over the Reed Sea against Egypt long ago.
\v 27
\q1 Then from your shoulders shall Assyria’s load be shifted
\q2 and from your neck his yoke shall then be lifted.
\q1 Assyria is on the march from Rimmon,
\v 28
\q2 he has reached Ai,
\q1 he has passed through Migron
\q2 and stored his baggage at Michmash,
\v 29
\q1 he is through the pass,
\q2 he bivouacs at Geba.
\q1 Ramah is in a panic,
\q2 Saul’s Gibeah is in flight;
\v 30
\q1 shriek, O folk of Gallim!
\q2 Listen, Laishah!
\q1 Answer them, Anathoth!
\v 31
\q2 Madmenah runs away,
\q2 the natives of Gibbim scurry for safety.
\v 32
\q1 To-day he is halting at Nob,
\q2 and shaking his fist at the hill of maiden Sion
\q2 at the hill of Jerusalem.
\v 33
\q1 But lo! the Lord, the Lord of hosts,
\q2 is lopping Assyria’s boughs with his axe:
\q1 the towering trees are felled,
\q2 and the lofty are laid low;
\v 34
\q1 he cuts away the woodland thickets,
\q2 fells the mighty cedars.
\c 11
\p
\v 1
\q1 From the stump of Jesse a shoot shall rise,
\q2 and a scion from his roots shall flourish;
\v 2
\q1 on him shall rest the spirit of the Eternal,
\q2 the spirit of wisdom and insight,
\q1 the spirit of counsel and strength,
\q2 the spirit that knows and reverences the Eternal.
\v 3
\q1 He will not judge by appearances,
\q2 nor decide by hearsay,
\v 4
\q1 but act with justice to the helpless
\q2 and decide fairly for the humble;
\q1 he will strike down the ruthless with his verdicts,
\q2 and slay the unjust with his sentences.
\v 5
\q1 Justice shall gird him up for action,
\q2 he shall be belted with trustworthiness.
\p
\v 6
\q1 The wolf shall couch then with the lamb,
\q2 the leopard’s lair shall be the kid’s;
\v 7
\q1 the lion shall eat straw like any ox,
\v 6
\q2 wolf and lion shall graze side by side,
\q2 herded by a little child;
\v 7
\q1 the cow and the bear shall be friends,
\q2 and their young lie down together;
\v 8
\q1 the infant shall play at the hole of an asp,
\q2 with the baby’s feet at the nest of a viper.
\v 9
\q1 None shall injure, none shall kill,
\q2 anywhere on my sacred hill
for the land shall be as full of the knowledge of the Eternal as the ocean-bed is full of water.
\v 10 And the Scion of Jesse who is to rally the peoples,
\q1 him shall the nations then consult,
\q2 and his seat shall be famous.
\v 11 Then shall the Lord put out his hand again to recover any of his people who survive, in Assyria and Egypt and Pathros and Kush and Elam and Shinar and Hamath and the sea-coasts.
\v 12
\q1 He will give the signal to the nations,
\q2 and gather the outcasts of Israel,
\q1 collecting the scattered of Judah
\q2 from the four corners of the earth.
\v 13
\q1 No more envy against Ephraim!--
\q2 the foes of Judah shall be cut off;
\q1 no longer shall Ephraim be jeal­ous of Judah,
\q2 or Judah oppose Ephraim;
\v 14
\q1 but side by side they’ll swoop down west
\q2 on the slopes of the Philis­tines,
\q2 and plunder the tribes of the east;
\q1 Edom and Moab they shall seize,
\q2 and rule over the Ammonites.
\v 15
\q1 And the Eternal will dry up the tongue of Egypt’s sea
\q2 with his hot breath
\q1 and swing his hand over the Euphrates,
\q2 striking it into seven wadie
\q2 that men can walk dry-shod;
\v 16 so shall there be a highroad for the survivors of his people to come back from Assyria, as there was for Israel on the day when it came up from the land of Egypt.
\c 12
\p
\v 1  On that day you shall sing:
\q1 “O Eternal, I adore thee
\q2 though thou wast angry with me,
\q1 thine anger has abated
\q2 thou art consoling me.
\v 2
\q1 Yes, God is my deliverance
\q2 I trust him unafraid
\q1 the Eternal is my strength, of him I sing,
\q2 he has delivered me indeed.”
\v 3 Joyfully then shall you draw upon the fountains of deliverance,
\v 4 and sing upon that day:
\q1 “Adore the Eternal
\q2 celebrate his name
\q1 tell the nations all that he has done,
\q2 record his mighty fame.
\v 5
\q1 Chant the Eternal’s praise, his glorious feats;
\q2 let the whole world know of it!
\v 6 Ring it out, dwellers in Sion, aloud,
\q2 for great is Israel’s Majesty among you.”

\v 1 The oracle on Babylon-- a vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz.
\v 2
\q1 On a bare hill, up with the signal!
\q2 shout to them loud
\q1 beckon them on to ente
\q2 the gates of the proud.
\v 3
\q1 For I have charged my chosen host
\q2 to execute my wrath
\q1 my heroes I have summoned
\q2 my men of martial pride.
\v 4
\q1 Hark! a din among the mountains,
\q2 as of a mighty host.
\q1 Hark! ’tis the uproar of empires
\q2 of nations gathering
\q1 for the Lord of hosts is mustering
\q2 a battle array.
\v 5
\q1 From a far land they are coming,
\q2 from the ends of the world-
\q1 ’tis the Eternal and the forces of his fury
\q2 to ruin all the earth!
\v 6
\q1 Shriek away! ’tis close, ’tis the Eternal’s day,
\q2 as a mighty blow from the Almighty;
\v 7
\q1 then shall all hands grow limp,
\q2 all hearts shall melt,
\v 8
\q2 and mortals be dismayed
\q1 seized with pangs and throes, they writhe
\q2 like a woman in her labour
\q1 staring each at the other aghast
\q2 their faces aflame.
\p
\v 9
\q1 Here comes the Eternal, pitiless,
\q2 in anger and in blazing wrath
\q1 to lay earth desolate
\q2 destroying sinful men.
\v 10
\q1 The skies and their great stars
\q2 now shed no light
\q1 the sun shall be dark at its rising,
\q2 the moon shall never be bright.
\v 11
\q1 “I will punish the world for its evil,
\q2 the wicked for their vice
\q2 the arrogance of proud men I will still,
\q2 and lay the haughtiness of tyrants low,
\v 12
\q1 till man becomes more rare than finest gold
\q2 men scarcer than gold ore from Ophir.”
\p
\v 13
\q1 So shall the skies be trembling
\q2 and earth be overturned
\q1 at the fury of the Lord of host
\q2 on the day his anger blazes.
\v 14
\q1 Then, like hunted gazelles,
\q2 like sheep unshepherded
\q1 shall men turn hurrying home
\q2 each off to his own land;
\v 15
\q1 anyone captured is cut down,
\q2 anyone caught is stabbed;
\v 16
\q1 their babes are dashed in pieces
\q2 under their very eyes
\q1 their houses are despoiled
\q2 their wives are ravished.
\p
\v 17
\q1 Against them I raise up
\q2 the Medes and Elamites
\q1 who care not for silver
\q2 nor gloat over gold;
\v 18
\q1 but, bow and spear in hand
\q2 fearful, ferocious
\q1 young men they cut to pieces
\q2 maids they massacre
\q1 a child they never spare
\q2 on babes they have no mercy.
\v 19
\q1 So shall Babylon, the splendour of empires,
\q2 the proud glory of the Chaldeans,
\q1 fare as Sodom and Gomorrah fared,
\q2 when God overthrew them.
\p
\v 20
\q1 Never shall it be tenanted
\q2 forlorn from age to age
\q1 there no nomads pitch their tents,
\q2 no shepherds fold their flocks;
\v 21
\q1 wild cats shall litter there,
\q2 and jackals fill the houses
\q1 ostriches shall live there
\q2 and wild goats shall leap,
\v 22
\q1 hyenas howl within the castles
\q2 wolves inside the lordly halls
\q1 And this, her doom, is near
\q2 her days shall not be long.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 [[For the Eternal will have pity upon Jacob and once more take Israel as his own, settling them in their own country, where foreigners shall join them and attach themselves to the household of Jacob.
\v 2 The household of Israel shall be conducted home by outside nations, and then Israel shall hold them as slaves in the land of the Eternal, thus making captives of their former captors, and ruling over their oppressors.
\v 3 Then shall it be that after the Eternal grants you relief from your agony and misery and the slavery you have had to suffer,
\v 4 you shall raise this taunt-song against the king of Babylon, crying:]]
\q1 How the tyrant is hushed,
\q2 his mad rage hushed!
\v 5
\q1 The club of the godless the Eternal has crushed
\q2 the rod of oppression,
\v 6
\q1 that smote the nations in a passion,
\q2 blow after blow
\q1 that enslaved races in a fur
\q2 and never let them go.
\v 7
\q1 Now the whole earth lies at peace,
\q2 bursting into song;
\v 8
\q1 the very cypresses exult,
\q2 the cedars of Lebanon cry
\q2 q1 “Now that you are fallen, no man seeks to fell us.”
\p
\v 9
\q1 The underworld is astir to greet you,
\q2 astir to meet you
\q1 rousing all the ghosts for you
\q2 that on earth were chieftains
\q1 moving monarchs of the world
\q2 from their thrones,
\v 10
\q1 to hail you, one and all of them
\q2 to cry to you,
\q1 “So you are weak now as we are?
\q2 So you fare as we fare?
\v 11
\q1 Your pomp has passed down to the world below
\q2 you and your peals of music
\q1 Maggots are spread under you
\q2 around your coverlet!”
\p
\v 12
\q1 What a fall from heaven on high,
\q2 O shining star of the dawn
\q1 How low and limp you lie
\q2 who once swayed all the nations!
\v 13
\q1 You, who once said to yourself,
\q2 “I will scale the sky,
\q1 I will set my throne supreme
\q2 above the stars on high,
\q1 I will sit on the hill of the god
\q2 in the far, far north;
\v 14
\q1 I will scale the cloud-banks
\q2 and rival the Most High!”
\v 15
\q1 And down you drop, to the world below,
\q2 down to death’s abyss you go!
\p
\v 16
\q1 Those who see you scan you
\q2 mark you and then muse,
\q1 “Is this the man who made earth tremble
\q2 who shook empires,
\v 17
\q1 who made a desert of the world
\q2 demolishing its cities
\q1 who never let a prisoner go
\q2 to return home?”
\v 18
\q1 Kings of the nations sleep in honour,
\q2 each within his tomb;
\v 19
\q1 but you are flung down where dead bodies lie
\q2 of men the sword has slain
\q1 unburied like a corpse trod under foot,
\q2 like a scion disowned. . .
\v 20
\q1 You shall sleep not with your father
\q2 in the grave;
\q1 for your country you have wasted,
\q2 your own people you have killed.
\q1 Never be the wicked’s rac
\q2 mentioned upon earth!
\v 21
\q1 His sons be slaughtered,
\q2 for their father’s guilt
\q1 lest they go on to seize the world
\q2 and multiply on all the earth!
\p
\v 22 I will rise against Babylon, the Lord of hosts declares, stripping it of its renown and of its remnant, of citizen and scion, the Eternal declares;
\v 23 I will turn it into pools of water and make it a mere haunt of bitterns; I will sweep it with a broom of bale, the Lord of hosts declares. . . .
\p
\v 24 The Lord of hosts has sworn
\q1 “As I have planned, so shall it stand,
\q2 as I have purposed, even so shall it be;
\v 25
\q1 the Assyrians I crush within my land,
\q2 and on my hills I trample them,
\q1 till from my people’s shoulders shall their load be shifted
\q2 and from their neck the s­syrian yoke be lifted.
\v 26
\q1 So is it in my purpose for the world,
\q2 so I stretched out my arm against all nations.
\v 27
\q1 The Eternal’s purpose who can disannul?
\q2 His outstretched arm, who turns it back?”
    * * *
\v 28 This oracle was in the year before king Ahaz died:
\v 29
\q1 “Rejoice not, all ye Philistines,
\q2 at the breaking of the club that beat you;
\q1 for from the snake a viper springs,
\q2 a flying serpent issues.
\v 30
\q1 The very poorest shall find pasture in my meadows
\q2 and there the needy shall be safe;
\q1 but I will slay your folk with famine,
\q2 I will kill off your survivors.
\v 31
\q1 Shriek at your gates, scream in your towns,
\q2 faint in your terror, all ye Philistines!
\q1 For smoke is rising from the north,
\q2 and yon invader’s ranks are close.
\v 32
\q1 What answer shall my people give the envoys of Philistia?
\q1 This, that Sion is founded by the Eternal,
\q2 and there shall his forlorn folk shelter.”

\v 1 The oracle on Moab:
\q1 “Ah, in the night was Ar-Moab stormed
\q2 was wrecked!
\q1 Ah, in a night Kir-Moab was stormed
\q2 was wrecked!
\v 2
\q1 The Dibonites climb to their shrine
\q2 to wail;
\q1 on Nebo and Medeb
\q2 Moabites howl;
\q1 all their heads are shaven
\q2 every beard is clipped;
\v 3
\q1 all wear sackcloth in the streets
\q2 bathed in tears;
\q1 on the housetops, in the square
\q2 they howl.
\v 4
\q1 Heshbon and Elealeh shriek--
\q2 ’tis heard as far as Jahaz;
\q1 a shudder runs through Moab
\q2 all hearts quiver.
\p
\v 5
\q1 My soul cries for poor Moab
\q2 as they fly to Zoar
\q1 winding their way weepin
\q2 up to Luhith
\q1 wailing, “We are ruined,
\q2 on the road to Horonaim.
\v 6
\q1 For the waters of Nimrim
\q2 are dry and waste
\q1 the herbage withered, the grass gone,
\q2 no green thing there
\v 7
\q1 so on they must carry
\q2 (on past the Wady of Willows)
\q1 what they have saved
\q2 what they have salved.
\v 8
\q1 The wailing sounds
\q2 from end to end of Moab;
\q1 ’tis heard as far as Eglaim
\q2 ae far as Beer-elim.
\v 9
\q1 Even Dibon’s streams run blood
\q2 yet I have more calamities for Dibon,
\q1 I will let lions loose on those who flee,
\q2 on those who make their way from Moab.
\c 16
\p
\v 1
\q1 And then at the fords of Arnon
\v 2
\q2 the folk of Moab shall flutte
\q1 like birds that scatt er
\q2 from a rifled nest,
\v 1
\q1 From Sela they sent tribute by the desert roa
\q2 to the ruler of the land of Judah, to mount Sion,
\v 3
\q1 crying, “Help us with your counsel
\q2 act for us;
\q1 shelter us with your strong shade
\q2 at the hot noon
\q1 take in our outcasts
\q2 betray not our fugitives;
\v 4
\q1 let our outcasts
\q2 live within your land
\q1 shelter Moa
\q2 from the ravagers.
\p
\q1 For when oppression ends
\q2 when ravaging is over
\q1 when the tyrant’s hee
\q2 has vanished from the land,
\v 5
\q1 then shall your throne be based on kindness
\q2 and in trustworthines
\q1 shall David’s dynasty sit there to rule,
\q2 bent upon justice and integrity.”
\p
\v 6
\q1 “No, we have heard of Moab’s pride;
\q2 they are so proud
\q1 so insolent, so haughty
\q2 so hollow and so loud!”
\v 7
\q1 Moab then is left to wail for Moab,
\q2 all Moab wails;
\q1 in misery they moan that rites have cease
\q2 at Kir-heres.
\v 8
\q1 For the vineyards of Heshbon wither,
\q2 with Sibmah’s vines
\q1 that once o’erpowered the rulers of the worl
\q2 with their rare wines
\q1 that once stretched north to Jazer,
\q2 and spread south to the desert,
\q1 their tendrils pushing far
\q2 to the Dead Sea on the west.
\p
\v 9
\q1 So I join Jazer in bewailin
\q2 Sibmah’s vines;
\q1 O Heshbon, Elealeh,
\q2 I drench you with my tears!
\q1 For the war-cry has sounde
\q2 over your gathered grapes
\v 10
\q1 and now the land of gardens is bereft
\q2 of joy and gladness
\q1 no singing in the vineyards now,
\q2 no merriment,
\q1 no wine is trodden out from grapes,
\q2 no lilting at the vintage!
\v 11
\q1 I thrill with pity for poor Moab
\q2 my heart is stirred for Kir-heres.
\v 12
\q1 Ah, when weary Moab mounts the hill,
\q2 praying within the shrine to no avail,
\q1 Moab shall then be ashamed of Kemosh,
\q2 and turn to the Eternal.

\v 13 Such was the word of the Eternal upon Moab in former days.
\v 14 But now his message is: “Within three years, no more, no less, shall Moab’s glory be a mockery, for all her mighty throng of people; and few and feeble shall be any who survive.”

\v 1 An oracle on Damascus:
\q1 Soon shall Damascus be no more a city,
\v 2
\q2 but lie for ever desolate in ruins,
\q1 her townships a sheep-run
\q2 where flocks lie unafraid;
\v 3
\q1 Ephraim shall lose its ramparts,
\q2 Damascus lose its royal power,
\q1 and Aram’s survivors shall perish—
\q2 so the Lord of hosts decrees.
\p
\v 4
\q1 Then shall Jacob’s strength be sapped,
\q2 his lusty vigour languish;
\v 5
\q1 ’twill be as when the standing com is reaped,
\q2 the ears in armfuls,
\v 6
\q1 or as when olive-trees are shaken,
\q2 and little there is left to glean
\q1 two or three berries on the topmost bough,
\q2 four or five berries on the twigs.
\p
\v 9
\q1 Your towns shall be deserted
\q2 like Amorite and Hivite ruins;
\v 10
\q1 for you forgot the God who was your help,
\q2 you heeded not the Stronghold of your strength
\q1 Therefore, though you plant gardens of Adonis
\q2 and stock them for a foreign god,
\v 11
\q1 forcing the growth, the very day you plant them
\q2 till they bloom for you the next morning,
\q1 all that you get from them shall vanish
\q2 on your day of dole and desperate pain.
\p
\v 7
\q1 Then shall men look to their Maker,
\q2 and turn to Israel’s Majesty,
\v 8
\q1 looking to nothing that their hands have made,
\q2 turning to nothing fashioned by their fingers.
    * * *
\v 12
\q1 Ah, the booming of many a people,
\q2 booming like sea breakers!
\q1 Ah, the thunder of great nations,
\q2 thundering like the surge of ocean!
\v 13
\q1 But the Eternal checks them
\q2 and they are chased afar,
\q1 driven like chaff before the wind
\q2 like dust whirled by the hurricane--
\v 14
\q1 at evening a terror,
\q2 and gone by morning!
\q1 Such is the fate of those who ravage us,
\q2 such is the lot of those who rifle us.
\c 18
\p
\v 1
\q1 Ah, land of winged fleets,
\q2 where the great Nile flows through,
\v 2
\q1 that sends its envoys oversea
\q2 in light skiffs down the stream!
\q1 Swift messengers, retur
\q2 to your people tall and bronzed,
\q1 a terror far and near
\q2 a sturdy race of conquerors;
\v 3
\q1 tell them, “Let all on earth
\q2 let all men in the world,
\q1 watch when the signal is raised
\q2 hark when the bugle is blown!”
\v 4
\q1 For this is the Eternal’s word to me,
\q2 “I will be on the watch from my abode,
\q1 calm as the clear heat in sunshine,
\q2 still as dew in harvest-tide.”
\v 5
\q1 For ere the harvest, when the blossom’s over,
\q2 when berries ripen into grapes,
\q1 he shall lop off the branches with a knife,
\q2 and cut away the tendrils;
\v 6
\q1 the foe shall be left to vultures in the hills,
\q2 and wild beasts of the land
\q1 all summer vultures shall devour them,
\q2 and wild beasts all the winter batten on them.
\p
\v 7  [[Then shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts at the place where he is revealed, at mount Sion, from a tall, bronzed people, a race that is a terror far and near, a sturdy race of conquerors, through whose land the great Nile flows.]]

\v 1 An oracle on Egypt:
\q1 Riding on a swift cloud the Eternal reaches Egypt
\q2 and Egypt’s idols shake before him,
\q2 Egypt’s courage melts away,
\v 2
\q1 “I will spur on Egypt against Egypt,
\q2 every man to fight his neighbour, fight his fellow
\q2 city against city, province against province.
\v 3
\q1 No spirit shall be left in Egypt;
\q2 I will confound their plans
\q1 till they resort to ghosts and idols,
\q2 wizards and mediums.
\v 4
\q1 I will hand Egypt over to a tyrant,
\q2 a despot shall reign over them,”
\q2 so the Lord, the Lord of hosts, decrees.
\p
\v 5
\q1 The Nile shall be dried up,
\q2 the river-bed shall be drained and bare,
\v 6
\q1 its branches shrivel and stink,
\q2 the canals of Egypt dry up
\q1 reeds and rushes wither,
\v 6
\q2 the meadow grass all moulders,
\q1 the green growth by the Nile is parched,
\q2 it droops and disappears.
\v 8
\q1 The fishermen shall be woebegone,
\q2 all who cast hooks in the Nile,
\q2 all who spread nets in the stream;
\v 9
\q1 dressers of flax shall be at their wits’ end,
\v 10
\q2 the weavers shall be daunted,
\q2 and all the workers downcast.
\p
\v 11
\q1 Poor fools are the princes of Zoan,
\q2 and witless the Pharaoh’s wisest councillors.
\q1 How dare you tell the Pharaoh,
\q2 “I am a wise man’s son, a son of ancient kings”?
\v 12
\q1 Where are your sages, pray?
\q2 Can they tell you, can they show you,
\q2 what plans the Lord of hosts has against Egypt?
\v 13
\q1 Why, Zoan’s princes are be- fooled,
\q2 the princes of Memphis are beguiled,
\q2 the leaders of her provinces lead Egypt astray
\v 14
\q1 the Eternal has so warped their judgment
\q2 that they lead Egypt all astray,
\q2 as a drunkard staggers vomiting;
\v 15
\q1 high or low, palm or rush,
\q2 none can do anything for Egypt.
\p
\v 16 [[Then shall Egypt tremble in terror like a woman, as the Lord of hosts swings his hand over it;
\v 17
\q1 the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt, the very mention of Judah will make the Egyptians dread what the Lord of hosts has planned against Egypt.
\p
\v 18 Then shall there be as many as five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the language of Canaan and loyal to the Lord of hosts, one of them called the City of the Sun.
\p
\v 19 Then shall there be an altar to the Eternal in the heart of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the Eternal on the frontier.
\v 20 This shall serve as a reminder and as a witness to the Lord of hosts within the land of Egypt; so that, when any who are oppressed cry to the Eternal to send a champion, he will intervene and rescue them.
\v 21 The Eternal will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall acknow­ledge the Eternal then, worshipping him with sacrifices and offerings, making vows to the Eternal and performing them.
\v 22 So the Eternal strikes Egypt, striking them and healing them; whenever they turn to the Eternal, he will heal them, in answer to their entreaty.
\p
\v 23 Then shall there be a highroad between Egypt and Assyria, Assyrians passing to Egypt and Egyptians to Assyria; Egyptians and Assyrians alike shall worship the Eternal.
\p
\v 24 Then shall Israel form a triple alliance with Egypt and Assyria--a blessing to the world around,
\v 25 and blessed by the Lord of hosts, who said, “Blessed be my people Egypt, Assyria whom I have made, and Israel my own possession!”]]
\c 20
\p
\v 2 Now the Eternal had bidden Isaiah the son of Amoz, “Go and strip the sackcloth off your waist and the shoes from your feet." He did so, going about without either robe or shoe.
\v 1 And in the year when the commander-in-chief, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked Ashdod, capturing it,
\v 3 the Eternal said, “As my servant Isaiah has gone for three years without robe or shoe, by way of omen and portent against Egypt and Ethiopia
\v 4 so shall the king of Assyria drive away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia young and old, without robe or shoe, and with bare buttocks;
\v 5 those who had hopes of Ethiopia and boasted of what Egypt would accomplish, shall be dismayed and abashed,
\v 6 and people on the coast will cry, ‘If this be the fate of those to whom we turned, hoping that they would rescue us from the king of Assyria, then how can we ourselves escape?’ ”

\v 1 A “Desert” oracle:
\q1 Like a hurricane hurtling
\q2 over the south-land,
\q1 there it is driving from the desert,
\q2 from the land of terror!
\v 2 A grim revelation, this, for me:
\q1 “Since the crafty still are crafty,
\q2 since the plunderers still plunder,
\q1 at them, O ye Elamites!
\q2 Medians, lay siege to them!
\q2 silence all their arrogance!”
\p
\v 3
\q1 It makes me writhe with anguish,
\q2 with pangs like a woman in travail;
\q1 I cannot hear for pain,
\q2 I cannot see for the shock;
\v 4
\q1 my brain is reeling,
\q2 the horror appals me;
\q1 the twilight I lov
\q2 is turned to shuddering.
\p
\v 5
\q1 There’s banqueting in Babylon
\q2 with tables spread,
\q1 and carpets laid!--
\q2 Up, princes! up, to arms!
\v 6
\q1 For tins is the Eternal’s word to me,
\q2 “Set your spirit on the watch,
\q2 to tell what it can see;
\v 7
\q1 if a cavalcade it be,
\q2 horsemen riding two by two
\q1 men on asses, men on camels
\q2 let it mark them heedfully.”
\p
\v 8
\q1 Then my spirit called to me
\q1 “Here on the watch, my lord,
\q2 all through the day I stand
\q1 here at my pos
\q2 night after night.”
\v 9
\q1 Just then a cavalcade rode by,
\q2 with horsemen two and two
\q1 and my spirit called to me
\q2 “Babylon has fallen, fallen
\q1 and her idols one and al
\q2 are shattered to the ground!”

\v 10
\q1 My poor crushed countrymen,
\q2 down-trodden folk
\q1 such is my message t

\q2 from Israel’s God.
\v 11 An oracle on Edom:
\q1 A voice calls out of Seir to me
\q1 “How far has the night gone, watchman?
\q2 How far has the night gone, watchman?”
\v 12
\q1 The watchman answers,
\q2 “Morning comes, morning--and night;
\q1 would you know more
\q2 come back to me again.”
\v 13 An oracle on Arabia:
\q1 In the bush at even you must camp,
\q2 you caravans of Dedanites;
\v 14
\q1 Bring them water for their thirst,
\q2 O natives of Tema
\q1 set before these fugitive
\q2 the bread they need;
\v 15
\q1 for they are flying from the sword,
\q2 from sword so sharp,
\q1 from the bent bows
\q2 from the press of battle.
\v 16 [[For this is the Eternal’s word to me: “Within a year, no more, no less, shall Kedar’s glory be all over

\v 1 An oracle on the glen of Hinnom:
\q1 Now why are you all swarming to your house-tops,
\q1 O shouting citizens, O surging 2 city,
\q2 all merry-making?
\q1 No sword your dead shall slay
\q2 they fall not in the fight,
\v 3
\q1 but all your chieftains run away
\q2 and take to flight.
\v 4
\q1 So let me alone, I pray,
\q2 I would lament bitterly
\q1 ply me not with consolation
\q2 for my country is undone.
\v 5
\q1 For the Lord, the Lord of hosts,is holding a da
\q2 of panic and riot and rout;
\q1 Kirites in the glen of Hinnom undermine the walls,
\q2 Shoites scale the heights;
\v 6
\q1 archers from Elam,
\q2 cavalry from Aram,
\q1 Kirites ready for the fray,
\v 7
\q2 fill all your fairest glens
\q1 with chariots and horseme
\q2 to assault your gates.
\v 8
\q1 Then to your armoury in Forest hall you look;
\v 9
\q2 you see the great gaps made in Davidsburg
[[you confine your water in the lower reservoirs,
\v 10 you number off the houses in Jerusalem and pull some down in order to repair the wall,
\v 11 and you construct a tank between the two walls for the water of the old reservoir]]; you never look to him who brings all this about, you never see who planned it long ago!
\p
\v 4
\q1 The Lord, the Lord of hosts, is calling yo
\q2 to tears and grief
\q2 to shave your heads and gird on sackcloth;
\v 13
\q1 and here is mirth and merrymaking!--
\q1 men slaughtering sheep and slaying kine,
\q1 men eating flesh and drinking wine,
\q2 feasting because “to-morrow we may die!”
\v 14
\q1 The Lord of hosts has sworn to me,
\q2 you cannot expiate this evil ere you die.
    * * *
\v 15
\q2 Against Shebna the governor of the palace.
The orders of the Lord the Eternal are: Come, go to yonder comptroller
\v 16
who is hewing out for himself a tomb high in the rock, and erecting a place of rest for himself; ask him, “What right have you here, what relatives have you here, that you are hewing out a tomb here?
\v 17
\q1 The Eternal will grip you tight
\q2 and wind you round and wrap you up
\v 18
\q1 and hurl you hurtling, man of might,
\q2 like a ball into a broad, far land;
\q1 and there your glorious tomb shall be,
\q2 there shall you die
\q2 you disgrace to the house of your lord!
\v 19
\q1 I will depose you from your post,
\q2 and pull you from your dignity.
\p
\v 20 Then I will summon my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkia
\v 21 and robe him in your vestment, binding your sash of office round him and handing over your authority to him; he shall prove a father to the citizens of Jerusalem and the household of Judah
\v 22 I will lay on his shoulders the duties of the Davidic palace, so that none may shut out when he opens, nor open when he shuts the door
\v 23 I will fix him fast in his position, like a peg in a firm wall, and through him shall his family rise to honour;
\v 24 his whole family shall depend on his support, both the members and the hangers-on, the very meanest vessels of them, be they bowls or pitchers, hanging on him as a peg.
\v 25 And then--so the Lord of hosts declares--the peg driven in so firmly shall be wrenched out and give way, till everything that hung upon it shall come down—for so the Eternal decrees.”

\q1 An oracle on Tyre:
\q1 Shriek for sorrow, ships of Tartessus,
\q2 for your haven is no more!
    You heard the tidings when you touched at Cyprus’ shore.
    The folk on the coast have 2 perished,
    the traders of Sidon, who traversed the sea, with sail-
    on many an ocean, who harvested wheat from the 3 Nile,
    who trafficked with many a nation.
    O	sea-power Sidon,	4
    mother of cities, lament in your shame:
    “The youths and maidens whom in pain I bore
    and brought up are no more.” [[When the tidings reach 5


    Egypt, the people are distressed at the tidings about Tyre.]]
        6 	Cross to Tartessus, wailing,
    O folk of the coast!
        7 	Is yon your merry city,
    that rose in days of yore, that spread so far afield in days gone by?
        8 	Whoever planned this doom for
    Tyre,
    the crowned queen, whose merchants were very princes,
    honoured in all the world?
        9 	’Twas the Lord of hosts who
    planned it, to abase man’s pride, to humble human splendour and whate’er earth honours.
    JO Shriek for sorrow, ships of Tar­tessus,
    for your haven is no more!
        3 	The Eternal’s blow, struck at
    the sea,
    has shaken realms on land; his order against Canaan runs, that her strong forts shall fall.
        4 	No merry-making now for you,
    O Sidon, a maiden deflowered! No rest for you, even although you cross to Cyprus! . . .
        5 	[[Look at the country of the Chaldeans, no longer a nation; the Assyrians have laid its cap­ital in ruins, a place for wild creatures of the desert; they erected their siege-works and overthrew its fortifications.]]
        6 	Shriek for sorrow, ships of Tar­
    tessus,
    for your haven is no more!
        7 	[[Then shall Tyre pass into oblivion for seventy years, for as long as a dynasty lasts; Tyre will be like the harlot in the song—
        8 	“Lift your lyre
    to roam the city, harlot whom all men forget!
    Play it with fire, sing many a ditty, that they may remember yet!”
    At the end of the seventy years 17 the Eternal will restore Tyre, till she regains her trade, traf­ficking with all the realms of the world over the wide earth; what she makes by her trade 18 shall be sacred to the Eternal, her profits are not to be stored or stowed away, but what she makes shall go to the Eternal’s devotees, to provide them with abundant food and choice at­tire.]]
    * * *
    Lo, the Eternal soon sy /% shall lay the earth bare and wild, rendering it shapeless and scattering its inhabitants; the 2 priest shall fare no better than the plain man, the master shall fare like the slave, mistress like maid, seller like buyer, borrower like lender, and creditor like debtor; the earth shall be laid all 3 bare, the world shall be stripped empty: such is the sentence of the Eternal.
    The earth is drooping, wither- 4 ing,
    the world is waning, wither­ing,
    and the sky wanes with the earth;
    for earth has been polluted 5 by the dwellers on its face, loose to laws and scorning stat­utes,
    breaking the eternal Com­pact.
    Therefore a curse is crushing 6 the earth,
    alighting on its guilty folk; mortals are dying off, till few are left.
    The vine-juice fails,
    the vines are dry, 11 the land cries out for wine, and merry-makers sigh;
        3 	no lilting now of tambourines,
    no lilting now of lutes, no sounds of revelry;
        4 	no singing as the wine is drunk,
    for any liquor has a bitter taste;
        5 	towns fall to pieces,
    each man bolts his door;
        6 	gladness has gone from the
    earth,
    and pleasure is no more;
        7 	the cities axe left desolate,
    their gates are battered down,
        8 	and few are left on earth, as
    few
    as berries, once the olive boughs are shaken, as grapes, when once the vin­tage has been taken.
        9 	Some at this raise shouts of joy,
    acclaiming overseas the Eter­nal’s might,
        10 	bidding the East own the Eter­
    nal’s might,
    and western shores acknowl­edge Israel’s God;
        11 	from earth’s far bounds the
    chorus sounds,
    “Now glory dawns for up­right men!”
    But ah I am in misery, alas, in utter misery!
    For the plunderers plunder on, they are plundering still.
        12 	Panic and pitfall and snares
    await you,
    O dwellers upon earth;
        13 	he who scurries from the panic
    steps into a pit, he creeps out and is caught within a snare.
    For the sluices in high heaven are opened,
    and earth shakes to its foun­dations;
    earth breaks to pieces,	19
    earth is split in pieces, earth shakes to pieces, earth reels like a drunken 20 man,
    earth rocks like a hammock; under the weight of its wrong­doing
    earth falls down, to rise no more.
    And then shall the Eternal pun- 21 ish
    the hosts of the high heaven above
    and kings on earth below, bundling them into a dungeon, 22 penning them inside a prison, till their day of doom arrives; the moon shall move under a 23 veil,
    the sun shall pale, when the Eternal is enthroned on Sion,
    revealed in radiant splendour to his sheikhs.
    Then on this hill of Sion ey c* for all nations	6
    the Lord of hosts will spread a banquet of rich food and of rare wines,
    of marrowy dainties and of choice old wines;
    and on this mountain shall he 7 strip away
    the mourning shroud from all mankind,
    the veil of sorrow from all na­tions,
    displacing death for evermore. 8 So shall he wipe the tears from every face,
    and free his own folk from taunts everywhere (’tis the Eternal’s own decree).
    Pass into your chamber, O 11/" my people,	20
    shut the door behind you; hide yourself inside, a moment, till his wrath blows by;
    21 for here is the Eternal issuing forth
    to punish mortals for their guilt!
    Earth shall reveal the blood shed on her face, and make all murders plain. syM Then with his great, grim, i “ • sweeping sword,
    shall the Eternal punish on that day
    the Snake in its flight, the Snake in its coils, and the Nile Dragon shall he
    slay;
        12 	that day the Eternal shall be
    threshing grain
    from the Euphrates even to Egypt,
    and glean you one by one, O Israel;
        13 	that day, when the great trum­
    pet sounds,
    men once forlorn in far As- syria,
    men outcasts within Egypt’s bounds,
    shall wend their way back to .Jerusalem
    to worship the Eternal on the sacred hill.
    O K. “Thou art my God, O Eternal,
    I adore thee, I extol thee, for wonders planned of old and brought to pass.
    Cities thou hast laid in heaps, citadels in ruins; proud castles are no more, none shall rebuild them.
        3 	At this shall tyrants own thy
    might,
    and pagan capitals hold thee in awe,
    5 for haughty pride thou layest low;
        4 	to hapless men thou art a
    strength,
    a strength to the forlorn in woe;
    a shelter from the storm, a shade in heat,
    silencing proud men as they 5 shout,
    and humbling tyrants.”
    On that day men sh-U say, 9 “Here is our God, at last, for whose aid we have waited! Here is the Eternal for whom we were waiting!
    O joy, O rapture—he has aided us!”
    For here upon this hill	10
    shall the Eternal grant us rest; but Moab yonder shall be tram­pled down,
    like straw among the dung; though Moab stretches out his 11 hands,
    as swimmers spread their hands to swim, his pride shall be abased, and all his craft with him.
    On that day this shall be rt/r the song	*t\J
    for Judah’s land:
    “Ours is a strong, sure city, safe with walls and ramparts set by Him;
    open its gates for the upright, 2 for folk who keep the faith. Thou dost protect and prosper 3 steadfast souls, for they rely on thee.
    Always rely on the Eternal, 4 for the Eternal’s strength en­dures;
    he has thrown down the dwellers 5
    on high,
    the towering city, levelling it to the earth, laying it low in the dust, till the oppressed can tread on it, 6 and the forlorn walk over it.
    For upright men the course is 7 smooth,
    for honest men thou makest the way straight.
        6 	And we have been waiting for
    thee, O Eternal, yearning for a sign of thee;
        7 	we have been yearning for thee
    in the night,
    our spirits eagerly in search of thee.
    For thy judgments bring men light,
    till very pagans learn the right, 10 But evil men who even in a good land
    will not learn to be good, they cease to be; the wicked shall be swept away, and the Eternal’s majesty they shall not see. 11 Thou art in action,
    and they see nothing; let them see, to their confu­sion,
    see thy jealous care for thine own folk!
    Let the fire kept for thy foes extinguish them, O thou Eter­nal!
        12 	But oh maintain our welfare;
    for whatsoever we achieve is all thy doing.
        13 	O thou Eternal, our own God,
    others have been ruling us; but thine authority alone to-day we own.
        14 	These lords are dead and gone,
    ghosts that return no more; thou hast demolished them, making their memory fade.
        15 	Thou hast added to our nation,
    extending its frontiers afar, and winning thyself honour.
        16 	We sought thee in our straits,
    we cried when we were crushed, when thou didst chasten us.
        17 	Thou didst make us, O Eternal,
    like a woman in her labour, near her time of travail, writhing in her pangs;
        18 	for we were labouring, writhing,
    and nothing came of it;
    we could not make our country
    safe,
    or overcome the world.
        O 	thou Eternal, thy dead shall 19
    live again,
    awakening from the dust with songs of joy; for thy dew falls with light and life,
    till dead spirits arise.”
    The lay of the lovesome cyj vineyard.	“ * 2
    “I, the Eternal, I am tending it, 3 I water it alway; lest any harm befall it,
        I 	guard it night and day.
        0 	need no walls for it,	4
    I war on any foes,
    burning them in the flames, these thorns and thistles, unless they cling to my strength, 5 and make their peace with me [[Then shall Jacob run its roots 6 down,
    Israel shall bud and blossom, covering the whole world with fruit]].”
    . . . He has struck the foe that 7 struck them,
    harder than the foe struck;
    he has cut up their destroyers,
    worse than they hurt Israel.
    Yet only when they grind to 9 dust
    their pagan altar-stones, and never raise again their sacred poles and pillars, shall Israel have their guilt for­given—
    for so their penitence must ■work.
    . . . For the fortified town lies 10 all forlorn,
    forsaken, abandoned, a waste, a place where calves go brows­ing,
    where the bushes grow to branches,
    11 where women break off the dry boughs
    to kindle fires.
    For the nation heed not God— so win no mercy from their Maker,
    no favour from their Creator. 8 He has expelled them into exile, taking issue with them, sweeping them off with a blast
    that blows hard from himself. * * *
    Woe to the lordly crown of Ephraim and his drunk­ards!
    Woe to their wreaths, so fair and rare,
    flowers fading upon men o’er- come with w’ine!
        1 	The Eternal has a stalwart foe
    for them,
    that beats and batters men to earth,
    like a blast of hail, a hurri­cane,
    like a storm of a surging flood;
        2 	and they shall be trampled
    down,
    Ephraim and his drunkards with their lordly crown,
        3 	their fading flowers, so fair and
    rare,
    at the head of the rich valley;
    they shall be swallowed like a fig in early summer, no sooner seen, no sooner seized,
    than swallowed!
        4 	[[On that day the Lord of hosts
    will be
    the proud crown and the peer­less diadem of his surviving folk,
        5 	inspiring the judge with justice
    and brave champions with courage.]]
    Yet here too men are reeling 7 drunk
    and staggering in their cups; prophets and priests are reeling drunk,
    fuddled with liquor; they reel amid their revela­tions,
    they stumble as they give their charges;
    they vomit foully over the sa- 8 cred tables,
    till not a place is clean.
    “Whom is he going to in- 9 struct?” they say of me; “to whom does he mean to impart his oracles? Is it to babies newly weaned, just taken from the breast? For he does noth- 10 ing but stammer about ‘law upon law, law upon law, line upon line, line upon line, a little here, a little there!’ ” “Yes, and 11 through stammering lips and in a foreign tongue will God talk to this people, the God who 12 told them once where true rest lay, rest for worn souls, refresh­ing rest; and yet they would not listen. So ‘law upon law,’ it 13 shall be, ‘law upon law, line upon line, line upon line, a lit­tle here, a little there,’ ”—that will be all the Eternal has to say to them—to make them trip and tumble backwards, till they are caught and captured.
    You scoffers, ruling in Jerusa- 14 lem here,
    listen to this word from the Eternal:
    you think you have struck 15 terms with death,
    and made your compact with the powers of doom, so that the surging scourge of a flood
    can never reach you, since you are safe behind a lie
    and sheltered by a falsehood!
        6 	Well, this is the Lord God’s
    word:
    “Here I lay Sion’s foundation, a rare and tested stone, secure and solid
    (he who has faith in me will never flinch);
        7 	I will build Sion up with jus­
    tice,
    and mould it upon equity.
    But your safe place the hail shall sweep away,
    and floods shall whelm your shelter;
        8 	your terms with death shall be
    revoked,
    and your compact with doom shall never hold; when the flood rushes over, down you go,
    under its surge you sink;
        9 	every morning it surges—by day
    and by night—
    and then you learn your les­son, to your terror!
        10 	(Your bed is too short, you can­
    not stretch yourself; your rug is too narrow to cover you.)
        11 	For the Eternal shall arise, as
    at mount Perazim, rise in wrath as in the glen of Gibeon,
    to deal as though he dealt with foreigners,
    to do his task, a task so strange to him.
        12 	Now, cease your scoffing,
    lest your ties be drawn the tighter;
    for I have heard the Lord of hosts decree
    doom fixed and final for the world.
    "I A On that day any Israelites 20J-” who are left,
    any survivors of the house of Jacob,
    no longer shall rely on him who proved their ruin, but rely steadily on the Eter­nal, Israel’s Majesty.
    A remnant, a mere remnant of 21 Jacob,
    shall come back to the Mighty God;
    for though your folk, O Israel, 22 are like sea-sands in num­ber,
    only a remnant of them shall return;
    destruction is decreed, a flood of retribution,
    for the Lord of hosts will 23 carry out
    doom fixed and final over all the world.
    Listen to me, hearken, AO hear my message, mark 23 it.
    Is a ploughman always plough- 24 ing,
    always harrowing up the soil?
    Once the field is smooth and 25 level,
    does he not scatter fennel seed and cummin,
    planting wheat and barley, with vetches on the border,
    guided aright by the Eternal, 26 prompted by his God?
    Then, fennel is not threshed with 27 sledges,
    cummin never needs a cart­wheel;
    men thresh fennel with a stick, and cummin with a flail;
    bread-corn is not ground to 28 pieces,
    no one threshes it for ever,
    but, once the cart-wheel passes o’er it,
    we spread it out, instead of crushing.
    ’Tis the Eternal who this lore 29 supplies.
    so great a Guide, so wonder­fully wise.

    “Woe to you, God’s own hearth and altar,
    O City where David camped! Let a year or two pass, and the feasts go round, a then I will press upon this hearth and altar,
    till moaning and bemoaning rise;
    I will sacrifice the altar,
        3 	I will beleaguer you,
    I will besiege you close,
    and set up forts against you.
        4 	Then shall you lie and whisper
    on the ground,
    murmuring humbly from the
    very dust,
    thin as a ghost’s your voice shall sound,
    a faint low twitter from the dust.”
        5 	Then swiftly, suddenly,
        6 	the Lord of hosts will punish
    you
    with thunder, earthquake, and a dreadful din,
    with storm, with whirlwind, and devouring flames.
        3 	[[But the horde of your foes to dust shall be shattered, the horde of the tyrants like chaff shall be scattered;
        3 	the horde of all nations
    pressing on God’s altar, they and all their array shall vanish away, like a dream in the night.
        4 	As a hungry man dreams he is
    eating
    and wakens still hungry, as a thirsty man dreams he is drinking
    and wakens still faint with his craving,
    so shall the horde of all nations fare
    that war upon mount Sion.]]
    Dazed shall you be, and amazed, 9 blind shall you be, blind, fuddled—not with wine, reeling—not with liquor; for the Eternal has drenched you 10 with stupor,
    closing your eyes and covering up your heads,
    till the sight of all this is to you 11 no more than words in a sealed scroll.” [[When men place it in the hands of a scholar, ask­ing him to read it, he answers,
    “I cannot; the scroll is sealed.” When it is handed to an illiterate 12 person, to be read, he answers, “But I cannot read.”]] “Since this people draw near me 13 with their mouth,” says the Eternal,
    “honouring me with their lips, while their hearts are far re­mote;
    since their religion is a mockery, a mere tradition learned by rote;
        I 	will now deal with them to 14 their amazement, bewildering, surprising them, till their wise men lose their wits, and their clever men are fooled.”
    Woe to the men who hide	15
    their plans from the Eternal, working in the dark, and think­ing,
    “No one sees or knows!”
    Perverse creatures that you are! 16 Is a potter no more than his clay?
    Dare anything deny its maker? Dare a pot hold the potter has no mind?
    “O self-willed sons,” says the Eternal,
    “bent on no plan of mine, weaving a treaty that I never sanctioned,
    and adding sin to sin;
        2 	who move away to Egypt
    without consulting me, to shelter beside the Pharaoh and get Egypt to protect them!
        3 	Your shelter shall bring shame
    to you,
    your protector shall confound you.
        4 	Your princes camp at Zoan,
    and your envoys reach Hanes,
        5 	all bearing presents
    to a nation of no use to you, a people that will bring no help or profit,
    but only shame, disgrace.
        6 	Through the desert to the south,
    over a toilsome, trying land, land of the lion and fierce lion­ess,
    land of the viper and the winged snake,
    they bear their wealth upon the backs of asses,
    their treasures on the camels’ humps,
    to a nation of no use to them,
        7 	whose aid is vain and idle [thence my name for it,
    ‘Dragon Do-nothing’]]!
        8 	Now, go in and write this down,
    inscribe it on a scroll, to serve in after days as a witness for all time.
        9 	It is a race rebellious,
    a faithless brood, children who will not listen to any of the Eternal’s laws, 10 who refuse visions from their seers
    and true words from their prophets,
    who would have only smooth things told them, only illusions prophesied, xi ‘Out of our way,’ they cry,
    ‘clear out from us, and trouble us no more with talk of Israel’s Majesty!’
    Well, here is the reply	12
    of Israel’s Majesty:
    Since you despise my warning and trust in wile and guile, and lean on your own policy, this guilt of yours shall split you, 13 like a high wall bulging to break,
    till swiftly, suddenly, down it crashes— as a man smashes	14
    a pitcher in pieces, so wantonly that not a shred re­mains
    to fetch fire from the hearth or water from the well.”
    The Lord, the Eternal, Israel’s 15 Majesty, he had declared,
    ‘‘Your safety lies in ceasing to make leagues,
    your strength is quiet faith.” But this you would not have, 16 you answered, “No, we must have cavalry to make a charge!”—
    your charge shall be a flight; “we need swift horses”— swift shall be your pursuers; let but five threaten, you shall 17
    fly,
    till few' are left of you, lonely like any pole upon the hills,
    like a lone signal on a moun­tain-top.
    Woe to those who make their way for help to Egypt, relying on her horse, and on her force of chariots, relying on her cavalry (they are so strong!) and never heeding Majesty,
    never consulting the
    Yet the Eternal has
    plans—doom
    and threats that may not be recalled;
    he will attack these schemers, and their evil allies.
        3 	Egyptians are but men, not God, their cavalry merely mortal; let the Eternal only strike, then shall supporter and sup­ported both collapse and crumble.
    ■4 For this is the Eternal’s word to me:
    As a lion or young lion growls over his prey, when the shepherds are all sum­moned
    to attack him;
    as their shouting never scares him,
    as their din never daunts him,
    so shall the Lord of hosts hold fast mount Sion.
        5 	Like a bird fluttering above its
    nest,
    shall the Eternal ward Jeru­salem,
    shielding her and saving her, sparing and preserving her.
        6 	O men of Israel, come back to
    him
    whom you have deeply wronged;
        7 	for on that day must men dis­
    dain
    the gold and silver idols each has made.
        8 	Then falls Assyria, by no hero’s
    sword,
    destroyed, but by no mortal blade;
    Assyrians fly before the Sword,
        9 	their very god flies in a panic, their princes scatter in sheer
    terror,
    their soldiers are made serfs— by order of the Eternal, whose hearth is in Sion,
    whose home-fires are within Jerusalem.
    Soon, very soon,	OQ
    shall forests turn to “17 orchards,
    and orchards be like woods. Then even the deaf shall hear 18 the word,
    and blind souls see out of their gloom;
    then humble folk shall find 19 new joy in the Eternal, the poorest shall exult in Israel’s Majesty.
    For tyrant foes shall vanish, 20 and scoffers be no more, and all men keen on crime shall be wiped out, men who gave false evidence, 21 deceiving judges on the bench, defrauding good men with a quibble.
    This therefore is the word of the 23 Eternal,
    the God of Jacob’s house, who rescued Abraham:
    “Never again shall Jacob be dis­mayed,
    never again disgraced; for once they see all that I do 23 among them, they will revere me, they will revere the Majesty of Jacob,
    they will hold Israel’s God in awe;
    the erring will gain insight, 24 and murmurers will accept the truth.”
    So the Eternal longs to oa favour you,	Ovr 18
    and moves to show you pity; for the Eternal is a loyal God;
    happy are all who long for him!
    No more tears for you,	19
    O folk of Sion in Jerusalem! For he will show you favour when you sigh,
    and answer you, soon as he hears your cry.
        20 	Though scant and scarce may
    be
    your bread and water from the Lord,
    yet he your Teacher never leaves you now;
    you see your Teacher for yourselves,
        21 	and when you swerve to right
    or left,
    you hear a Voice behind you whispering,
    “This is the way, walk here.”
        22 	Then all your idols shall you
    desecrate,
    metal or wood, plated with gold or silver,
    flinging them from you in dis­gust,
    and bidding them begone.
        23 	Rain shall be sent you for the
    seed
    you sow upon the field, and heavy crops of wheat the earth
    shall amply yield.
    Your cattle shall go grazing over pastures broad;
        24 	oxen and asses for the plough
    shall eat their fodder, mixed with salt,
    and winnowed well.
        25 	Even on the upper slopes and all
    high hills
    streams shall be flowing, upon that Day of doom and slaughter,
    when the foe’s forts are falling;
        26 	and moonlight glows like sun­
    light,
    and the sun shines sevenfold strong,
    on that Day when the Eternal heals his bruised folk, when he binds up their wounds.
        27 	Here comes the Eternal from afar
    in blazing wrath, with heavy thunder-clouds, with angry foam upon his lips and a tongue like a devouring fire,
    breathing fury like a flood	28
    that reaches to the neck, to sift the nations till they are undone,
    to drive men with a halter to
    their doom!
    Then shall a song be yours like 29 the song
    on a festival night, as joyous as men who with music are moving to Israel’s great God, to the Eternal’s hill.
    And the Eternal will thunder 30 in triumph,
    and swing his arm down plain, in a fury of anger, with flames that devour,
    storming with hail and with rain.
    At the Eternal’s voice of 31 thunder,
    the Assyrians are appalled; he fights them to the death and 32 clubs them down, to peals of merry music; the pyre to burn them is pre- 33 pared,
    both deep and wide, piled high with logs set blazing
    by the breath
    of the Eternal like a fiery tide.
    One day a King shall reign o ey in justice,	OZ
    with princes that rule up­rightly,
    each like a shelter from a 2 storm,
    a refuge from sore rain, like streams of water in a parched waste,
    like the shade of a cliff in a dry, weary plain.
        3 	Then eyes that see shall not be
    closed,
    and ears that hear shall listen;
        4 	the hasty shall learn how to
    judge,
    and stammerers shall speak clearly;
        5 	the impious shall be called no
    more “your honour,” and knaves no more be ranked as noblemen.
        6 	For the impious talks impiously,
    his mind is bent on evil, to do ungodly deeds and to malign the Eternal; he leaves hungry folk to starve, and stints the thirsty of their drink.
        7 	The knave has knavish ways,
    the villain is devising plans to ruin poor folk with his lies, though they are in the right;
        8 	but noble are the noble’s plans,
    and nobly does he make them good.
        9 	O women lolling at your ease,
    hear what I say!
    O daughters in your careless confidence, mark this my word!
        10 	In little more than a year,
    you shall be shuddering, de­spite your confidence; for the vintage shall fail, and no fruit be gathered.
        11 	Then tremble, women at your
    ease,
    shudder, you careless crea­tures,
    strip yourselves bare, with sackcloth round your waist,
    is and beat your breasts in mourn- ing
    for fair fields and fruitful vines, 13 for the country of my people o’ergrown with thorny weeds, for all the country-houses,
    and the festive capital, the citadels forsaken,	14
    the busy towns abandoned, their high ground for all time an empty waste, where the wild ass shall roam, where flocks shall graze; for the forests shall be felled, 19 and the capital laid low.
    Yet one day from the heights of 15 heaven
    a spirit shall breathe into us, till the downs grow like an orchard,
    and the orchard like a forest; then justice fills the very downs, 16 and honesty the orchards, and justice brings us welfare, 17 honesty renders us secure; my people shall have homes of 18 peace,
    resting in houses undisturbed.
    Ah, happy folk, to sow land 20 watered everywhere, and let your ass and ox range free!
    » * *
    Woe to you, O ravager, O whom none has ever 30 ravaged!
    Woe to you, O plunderer, whom none has ever plun­dered!
    Once your ravaging is over, ravaged shall you be; once your plundering is past, plundered shall you be.
    O thou Eternal, show us favour, 2 we have been waiting for thee; be our strong arm, morn after morn,
    deliver us, all forlorn.
    At the sound of thy storm the 3 nations flee;
    men scatter, once thou stirrest, till we loot them like locusts, 4 and swarm like grasshoppers over their spoil.
        5 	The Eternal is supreme, he
    dwells on high;
    justice and equity he lavishes on Sion,
        6 	a saving wealth of knowledge
    and of wisdom,
    and godly reverence as our treasure.
        7 	When warriors wail in the open,
    and the envoys of peace weep sore,
        8 	at treaties broken by the ruth­
    less foe,
    reckless of any pledge;
        9 	when the land laments and lan­
    guishes,
    when Lebanon withers in shame,
    and Sharon sinks to a desert, and Bashan and Karmel are leafless;
    10	the Eternal cries, “Now I arise, I will exalt myself; 11 foes of my folk, your plans are all futile,
    your fury shall consume your­selves;
    13 nations shall be burned to ashes, like thorn-bushes cut and kindled;
        13 	till lands afar hear all that I
    have done,
    and the near lands own my might.”
        14 	In Sion sinful men are terrified,
    the impious are seized with shuddering,
    crying, “Oh who can live with such a devouring Fire?
    Who can live on, with such a lasting Flame?”
        15 	He who scorns to profit by op­
    pression,
    he who will not clutch at any bribe,
    he who listens to no plans of murder,
    he who will not look at crime,
    he who lives uprightly, just in word and deed,
    he shall dwell far out of reach 16 of harm,
    as in a stronghold on the cliff,
    secure,
    his bread provided, and his water sure.
    Your eyes shall see the King in 17 all his splendour, and gaze upon his broad domain;
    till, musing on the terror that 18 has vanished,
    you ask, “Where are the tyrant’s officers,
    who taxed us, charged us, took our tribute?”
    These insolent creatures you 19 shall see no more, that folk with foreign tongue mysterious,
    who chattered in a jargon
    meaningless.
    No, you shall see your quiet 20 home,
    Jerusalem immovable, a tent whose pegs shall never he pulled up,
    whose ropes are never to be rent.
    And there, instead of broad 2\ streams circling round, we have the glorious Eternal as our river,
    a river never raided by a galley, sailed by no ships of war;
    the Eternal himself rules us, 22 the Eternal is our captain, the Eternal is our king, he, he alone, defends us;
        23 	even blind folk then shall share
    rich plunder,
    even lame folk loot at large;
        24 	none in the land shall say then:
    “I am sick,”
    for all who live there have
    their sins forgiven.
    * * *
    Draw near, O nations, hear, O peoples, listen, O earth and all earth holds,
    O world of men!
        2 	For the Eternal is wroth against
    all nations,
    furious with the host of them; he has doomed them to destruc­tion,
    left them to be massacred;
        3 	their slain shall be flung out,
    and a stench rise from their corpses;
    the mountains shall be running with their blood, the hills are drenched and all dissolve;
        4 	the very sky shall roll up like a
    scroll,
    and all the stars shall fade, as leaves fade falling from a vine, and foliage from a fig-tree.
        5 	For the Eternal’s sword in
    heaven
    is tempered keen with fury; and there it flashes down on Edom,
    dooming that accursed race!
        6 	The Eternal’s sword is gorged
    with blood,
    greased with the fat of its vic­tims,
    with blood of common human folk,
    with fat of the low crowd;
        7 	and leaders shall be struck down
    too,
    nobles and notables;
    for the Eternal holds a sacrifice at Busaireh,
    and slaughters victims in the land of Edom;
    their blood shall soak the coun­try,
    and their fat shall smear the dust;
    ’tis the Eternal’s hour of ven- 8 geance on them, to repay them for all their wrongs to Sion.
    All streams turn into jutch, 9 the very dust turns brim­stone;
    the land is a mass of pitch that burns on, night and day, 10
    that never shall be quenched— age after age its smoke goes up—
    it lies waste for all time, and no man ever crosses it;
    a haunt of pelicans and bitterns, 11 a place for owls and ravens,
    marked out for wreck and wrack by the Eternal, measured for abolition.
    Demons haunt the spot,	12
    for the nobles now are gone;
    there no kingdom is proclaimed, the princes are no more;
    thorns thrive, where once were 13 palaces,
    nettles and thistles fill the forts;
    there jackals prowl, there quarter ostriches,
    wild cats hunt with hyenas,	14
    and demon calls to demon;
    there vampires settle, to make themselves a home;
    there nest the arrow-snakes and 15 lay their eggs,
    brooding and hatching them out;
    there vultures gather, none without its mate;
        13 	these creatures are all summoned
    by the Eternal, and not one fails to come; the Eternal has himself com­manded them,
    and at his impulse have they gathered;
        14 	he has allotted them the land,
    he has assigned it as their home,
    theirs for all time, their haunt from age to age.
    Let desert and dry land be glad,
    let steppes rejoice and flower, flowering like narcissus blooms,
        2 	and ringing with delight,
    sharing Lebanon’s lavish growth, Sharon and Karmel’s splen­dour,
    and seeing thus the Eternal’s living power,
    the splendour of our God!
        3 	Put heart into the listless,
    and brace all weak-kneed souls,
        4 	tell men with fluttering hearts,
    “Have courage, never fear;
    here comes your God, he will avenge his folk, here comes God’s retribution, he comes himself to save you!”
        5 	And then the blind shall see,
    the deaf shall hear;
        6 	then shall the lame leap like a
    deer,
    and dumb tongues sing for joy.
    For in the desert brooks break out,
    streams in the very steppes; parched land becomes a pool, 7 dry ground is gushing with water;
    the jackals’ and hyenas’ lair shall turn to pasture for your flocks,
    and reeds and rushes shall be flourishing
    where once the ostrich quar­tered;
    a stainless highroad shall appear, 8 its name “The Sacred Way”; no soul unclean shall tread it, no impious foot stray over it;
    no lions shall ever haunt it, 9 no wild beast leap on it; but on it the redeemed shall walk,
    those whom the Eternal has 10 set free;
    they come home to Sion singing, crowned with an unending joy; joy and gladness overtake them,
    sorrow and sighs forsake them.

    Now Hezekiah fell ill and on was at the point of death; O the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz went and gave him this message from the Eternal, “Put your affairs in order, for you are to die, not to recover.” Then 2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Eternal,
    “O Eternal, pray remember 3 how I have lived ever mindful of thee, honestly and heartily, and how I have done what was right in thy sight!” Hezekiah 4 wept aloud. Then this word came from the Eternal to Isaiah: “Go and give Hezekiah this 5 message from the Eternal, the God of his father David, ‘I have heard your prayers, I have seen your tears, and I now add fif­teen years to your life; also I 6
    will rescue both you and this city from the king of Assyria,
        21 	I will defend this city.’ ” Then Isaiah ordered a poultice of figs to be applied to the eruption,
        22 	that he might recover. And when Hezekiah asked, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the temple of the Eternal?”
        2 	he answered, “This shall be a sign to you from the Eternal that he will do as he has prom-
        3 	ised; he will put back the shadow of the sun for ten steps on yonder dial of Ahaz.” And the shadow of the sun did move back for ten steps on the dial.
        4 	A piece composed by Heze­kiah king of Judah, after he had been ill and had recovered from his illness:
        5 	Methought I must depart
    when life was at its noon, and pass within death’s portals for my remaining years;
        6 	methought I was no more to see
    the Eternal
    in the land of the living, and never to behold a man again within this world.
        7 	“My home is broken up,” I
    wailed,
    “pulled up like a shepherd’s tent;
    my life is rolled up like a web, cut from the thrum; in one day I am doomed,
        8 	and all the night I moan, for my agony is like a lion,
    breaking every bone.”
        9 	Murmuring like a swallow,
    moaning like a dove,
    I lifted longing eyes to heaven, crying, “Remember me, re­lease me, O Eternal!
        10 	And yet what can I say to him,
    who himself does this to me?
    I toss on through the hours of sleep
    in bitterness of soul.
    O Lord, my heart in hope 16 relies on thee; refresh me and revive me, grant me recovery;
    Oh keep my life from dropping 17 down to the pit of doom!
    Oh cast behind thy back all my iniquities!”
    For death-land cannot thank 18 thee,
    death cannot sing thy praise, and those who pass down to the pit
    have no hope of thy love;
    ’tis living men who praise thee, 19 as I praise thee to-day— the father telling to his sons how true thou art.
    [[Be pleased, O thou Eternal, to 20 deliver us; then all our days we shall make music at thy house
    unto thy praise.]]
    It was then that Mero- OQ dach-baladan, son of Bala- dan, king of Babylon, sent eu­nuchs with a present to Heze­kiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been ill. Hezekiah was de- 2 lighted, and displayed all his treasures, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil in his stores, besides his armoury; there was nothing in his palace or in­deed in all his realm that he did not display to them.
    But the prophet Isaiah went 3 to king Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say? Where may they have come from?” Hezekiah replied, “They have come from a far country,
        4 	from Babylon.” “And what did they see in your palace?” Heze­kiah answered, “They saw every­thing in my palace; there is nothing of all my treasure that
        5 	I did not show to them.” Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, “Lis­ten to this word from the Lord
        6 	of hosts: ‘The day is coming when all in your palace, with all that your fathers have ever stored up, shall be carried off to Babylon; nothing shall be left,’
        7 	says the Eternal. ‘The sons born to you, born of your body, shall be taken away to be eunuchs in the palace of the
        8 	king of Babylon.’ ” “Very good,” said Hezekiah to Isaiah; “so the Eternal has spoken by you” (thinking to himself that there would be no trouble or change at least so long as he was alive.)
    It was in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah that Sancherib king of Assyria marched against all the fortified towns of Judah and captured
        2 	them. The king of Assyria sent his staff-commander with a large army from Lakhish to king Hezekiah at Jerusalem; he took up a position beside the conduit of the upper pool on the way to
        3 	Fuller’s Field, and when ElTakim the son of Hilkiah, who was prefect of the palace, with Shebna the secretary and Joab the son of Asaph the chancellor,
        4 	came forward, the staff-com­mander gave them this message for Hezekiah: “The great mon­arch, the king of Assyria, asks Hezekiah, ‘On what are you
        5 	resting your confidence? You think mere talk will do, as policy and power in war? Who are you trusting to, that you rebel
        6 	against me? You trust to this broken reed of a staff, Egypt, that will pierce the hand of any
    man who leans upon it! That is all the Pharaoh king of Egypt does for anyone who trusts to him. If you tell me that you 7 trust to the Eternal your God, is this not the very Eternal whose shrines and altars Heze­kiah has removed, telling Judah and Jerusalem that they are to worship at this altar here?’ Come,” added the staff-corn- 8 mander, “make this wager with my master the king of Assyria:
    I will give you two thousand horses, if you can put as many riders on their backs! How, 9 then, can you repulse even the weakest of my master’s officers, trusting to Egypt for chariots and cavalry? Have I marched 10 against this country to destroy it, without the sanction of the Eternal? No, the Eternal told me to march against this country and destroy it.” Ella- 11 kim the son of Hilkiah and Shebna and Joab said to the staff-commander, “Pray speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; do not speak to us in the Jews’ lan­guage, with the people listen­ing on the wall.” But the staff- 12 commander replied, “Did my master send me with this men­ace for your master and for you, and not for the men sitting on the wall—doomed along with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”
    And the staff-commander 13 stepped forward, shouting aloud in the Jews’ language, “Listen to this word from the great mon­arch, the king of Assyria! The 14 king warns you not to let Heze­kiah delude you; he will never be able to save you. Nor let Heze- 13 kiah induce you to trust in the Eternal by telling you that the Eternal will be sure to save you
    and prevent this town from fall­ing into the hands of the king
        2 	of Assyria. Never heed Heze- kiah. The king of Assyria’s advice to you is ‘Make your peace with me, surrender to me, and then you can each eat the fruit of your vine and your fig- tree and drink from your own
        3 	water-supply, until I come to deport you to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vine-
        4 	yards. Beware of letting Heze- kiah persuade you that the Eternal will save you. Has any god of any nation ever yet saved his land from the hands
        5 	of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have the gods of Samaria saved Samaria
        6 	from me? What gods, of all the gods of these lands, have saved their lands from me, that the Eternal should now save Jerusalem from me?’ ”
        7 	The men said nothing, they made no reply, for the king had ordered them to make no an-
        8 	swer; Eliakim the son of Hil- kiah, who was prefect of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and Joab the son of Asaph the chancellor, went, tearing their clothes, to Hezekiah, to report what the staff-commander had
    said. When Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went into the
        2 	temple of the Eternal; Eliakim the prefect of the palace, Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests he sent, robed in sack­cloth, to the prophet Isaiah the
        3 	son of Amoz, with this message
    from Hezekiah: “This is a day of distress, of disruption, and of disgrace:	‘children come to
    birth, and no strength in the
    mother!’ It may be that the 4 Eternal your God will hear all that the staff-commander has said, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to insult the living God; it may be that the Eternal your God will have some retort for the words he has heard. Pray, then, for this remnant of the people.” When 5 the deputation from king Heze­kiah came to Isaiah, he gave 6 them this message from the Eternal for their master: “Fear not what you have heard from these officers of the king of Assyria who blasphemes me.
    I will dispirit him by making 7 him hear a rumour, so that he shall go back to his own country and fall by the sword in his own country.”
    The staff-commander, hearing 8 that the king of Assyria had left Lakhish, went to find him besieging Libnah. But as news 9 came that Tirhakah king of Ethiopia had suddenly marched to attack him, Sancherib king 37 of Assyria went away back to Nineveh, where he lived. One 38 day, as he was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch his god, his sons Adrammelek and Sha- rezer cut him down with their swords and then escaped to the land of Armenia. Esarhaddon his son reigned instead of him.
    [[. . . And he sent messen- 9 gers to Hezekiah with this mes­sage for Hezekiah king of Judah. “Let not your God in whom 10 you trust delude you by prom­ising that Jerusalem shall not fall into the hands of the king of Assyria. You have heard what 11 the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by way of utter de­struction; and are you to escape? Were the nations whom my 12 fathers destroyed saved by their
    gods—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the Edenites of Telassar?
        13 	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of
        14 	Iwah?” On receiving this letter from the messengers, Hez- ekiah read it and went up into the temple of the Eternal, where he spread it out before the Eter-
        15 	nal and prayed to the Eternal,
        16 	crying, “O Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, enthroned upon the kherubs, thou art the God, thou only, of all realms on earth; thou hast made heaven and
        17 	earth. Bend thine ear, O Eter­nal, listen! Open thine eyes, O Eternal, look! Listen to this message sent by Sancherib to
        18 	insult the living God. The kings of Assyria have indeed utterly destroyed all countries, O Eter-
        19 	nal, burning up their gods— gods that were no gods at all, mere things of wood and stone that men had made; so they
        20 	were destroyed! But save us, O thou Eternal our God, oh save us from his power, that all realms upon earth may know that thou alone, O Eternal, thou art God!”
        21 	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent Hezekiah this message from the Eternal the God of Israel: “As you have prayed to me against Sancherib the king of
        33 	Assyria, so the Eternal declares that the king of Assyria shall never reach this town, never shoot an arrow at it, never appear in front of it with a shield, never throw up a mound
        34 	against it; by the way he came shall he return, he shall never reach this town, the Eternal de-
        35 	dares, for I will defend this town, to rescue it for my own sake and for my servant David’s sake.”
    That very night the angel of 3d the Eternal went out and killed a hundred and eighty-five thou­sand men in the Assyrian camp; they were all found to be dead corpses in the morning.l]
    [[This is the word of the Eternal 22 about him:
    “She scorns you, she laughs at you,
    Sion the maiden, she tosses her head at you, Jerusalem the maid.
    Whom have you reviled and 23 blasphemed?
    At whom have you dared raise your voice?
    You have reviled the Lord 24 through your messengers, vaunting, ‘With my host of chariots
    I have scaled high mountains, and reached the ravines of Lebanon;
    I fell its tallest cedars, and its rare cypresses,
    I push right into its recesses, where its rich woods are dense.
    I dig wells abroad	25
    and drink of them,
    I put my foot down and dry up all Egypt’s streams.’
    But have you never learned, 26 the Eternal asks,
    I did all this, I planned this long ago?
    ’Twas I who from the first con ­ceived it,
    ’tis I who make it now your task
    to lay strong fortresses in ruins, till helpless citizens collapse 27 dismayed;
    like grass in field or on the downs,
    like grass on the house-top they fade.
    Every move you make, I know 28 it;
    I hear you raging recklessly 29 at me;
    so through you,	T run my
    ring,
    and run my bridle between your lips,
    and drive you back again by the very road you came.” 30 You shall have proof of this: for while you feed this year on casual grains, and next year on what springs from casual grains, in the third year you can sow
    and reap a crop, you. plant ■vineyards and enjoy their fruit. And what survives of the house 31 of Judah, the remnant, shall once more strike down its mots and then rise to be fruit­ful; for a remnant of survivors 32 shall spread out from Jerusalem and from mount Sion—thanks to the jealous care of the Eter­nal.]]



    Console my people, console them—
    ’tis the voice of your God—
        2 	speak to Jerusalem tenderly,
    proclaim to her that her hard days are ended, her guilt paid off, that she has received from the Eternal’s hand
    full punishment for all her sins.
        3 	Hark! there is one calling,
    “Clear the way for the Eternal through the waste,
    level a highroad for our God across the desert:
        4 	every valley must be filled up,
    every mountain and hill lowered,
    rough places smoothed, and ridges turned into a plain
        5 	[[and the Eternal’s glory shall
    be revealed before the eyes of all: such are the orders of the Eter­nal]].
        4 	Up to the high hills,
    O	herald of happiness to Sion! Raise your voice loudly,
    O herald of happiness to Jeru­salem,
    raise it fearlessly, and tell the towns of Judah, ‘Here is your God! 10 Here is the Eternal coming in power,
    maintaining mightily his cause!
    Here he is bringing what he has won,
    bringing what he has gained!
    For he feeds his flock like an shepherd,
    and gathers them in his arms,
    he is carrying the lambs in his bosom,
    and leading the ewes gently.’ ”
    Hark, there is one calling, “Cry!” 6 I ask, “What shall I cry?”
    This: that all men are grass, and all their glory like a flower in the field;
    grass withers and flowers fade, 7
    because the breath of the
    Eternal blows upon them;
    grass withers and flowers fade, 8 but our God’s promise stands for evermore.
    Who ever measured the waters 12 in the hollow of his hand, or ruled the skies off with a span,
    or held the dust of earth inside a measure,
    or weighed the mountains in a pair of scales, the hills within a balance?
    Who ever moved the mind of the 13 Eternal,
    or gave him lessons andadvice?
    Who ever was called in to give 14 him counsel?
    Who ever taught him how to act,
    or showed him what to do?


        15 	Why, the nations are a mere
    drop in the bucket, no more to him than dust upon a balance!
    He lifts lands like a straw!
        16 	Even Lebanon is not fuel
    enough for him, nor its cattle a sufficient sac­rifice.
        17 	Before him all the nations are as
    nothing;
    to him they are but empty and inane.
        18 	Then whom can you compare
    with God?
    What can you put beside him?
        19 	A metal image?—that the work­
    man casts, the goldsmith gilds, a 1 everyone helping the other,
        2 	x1-*- and cheering his com­
    rade on,
        3 	the workman encouraging the
    goldsmith,
    the carpenter the blacksmith, the solderer plating his work, and fastening it tight with nails!
    Af\ While he who carves an
        15 	jd0j out of wood, chooses a tree that will not
    rot,
    then gets a clever carpenter to set him up an idol that will stand!
        16 	Can you not understand, cannot
    you see?
    Were you not told this from the first,
    have you not grasped this, since the world began?—
        17 	that He sits over the round
    earth, so high
    that its inhabitants look like grasshoppers;
    he spreads the skies out like a curtain,
    and stretches them like a tent; he brings nobles down to 23 nothing,
    he ruins rulers of the world— scarcely planted, scarcely sown, 24 scarcely rooted in the earth, when at a puff from him they wither,
    the storm sweeps them off like straws.
    “To whom will you compare me, 25 then,
    and equal me?” asks the Ma­jestic One.
    Lift high your eyes, look up; 26 who made these stars? he who marshals them in order, summoning each one by name.
    For fear of him, so mighty and so strong,
    not one fails to appear.
    Why do you complain, O Jacob, 27 why do you cry, O Israel,
    “My fate the Eternal never notices,
    my rights are unregarded by my God”?
    Come now! Do you not under- 28 stand,
    have you not heard, that the Eternal is an ever­lasting God,
    the maker of the world from end to end?
    He never faints, never is weary, his insight is unsearchable; into the weary he puts power, 29 and adds new strength to the weak.
    Young men may faint and 30 weary,
    the strong youths may give way,
    but those who wait for the Eter- 31 nal shall renew their strength,
    they put out wings like eagles, they run and never weary, they walk and never faint.
    Come to me, O lands, in si­lence,
    wait until I speak, O nations;
    come hither—you can speak later on—
    let us meet in argument.
        2 	Who roused up from the east
    the man whom victory ever attends?
    Who lets him have nations as a gift
    and lays kings low before him?
    His sword drives them like dust,
    his bow like chaff before the wind;
        3 	he chases them, and passes for­
    ward safely,
    swiftly with feet that never touch the ground.
        4 	Who brought this about, who
    did it?
    ’Twas he who summons the generations from the begin­ning,
    ’twas I the Eternal, I who am the first
    and at the last the same.
        5 	But, O Israel my servant,
    O my chosen Jacob,
        O race of Abraham my friend,
    9 whom I fetched from afar
    and called from earth’s far end,
    to whom I said, “You are my servant,
        1 	have not rejected, I have chosen you,”
        4 	fear not, for I am with you,
    I am your God, be not dis­mayed;
    I will strengthen, I will support you,
    I will uphold you with my trusty hand.
        5 	All who are enraged at you
    shall be defeated and con­founded,
    those who quarrel with you
    shall vanish into nothing;
    you will not find them when you 12 look for them,
    those men who strove with you:
    they shall turn to a mere nothing,
    those who war against you.
    For I the Eternal your God hold 13 you by the hand, whispering, “Fear not, I will help you.”
    Fear not, puny Jacob, petty 14 'Israel,
    I will help you,
    your champion is the Majestic One of Israel— it is the Eternal’s promise.
    Lo, I will make you a new 15 threshing sledge furnished with sharp teeth, threshing mountains and beat­ing them small, turning the very hills to chaff;
    you shall fan them till the wind 16 whirls them off, and the blast scatters them, while you exult in the Eternal and glory in His Majesty of Israel.
    When poor, forlorn folk vainly 17 seek for water,
    with tongues that are parched by thirst,
    I the Eternal will answer them,
    I Israel’s God will not forsake them;
    on the bare heights I will open 18 rivers,
    and in the valleys fountains,
    I will make deserts into lakes, and dry land into springs of water;
    I will plant cedars in the desert, 19
    acacias, myrtles, olive-trees;
    I will put fir-trees in the steppes, and planes and cypresses; that men may see and under- 20 stand,
    consider and agree that the Eternal’s hand has done it,
    that Israel’s Majesty has made it all.
    * * *
        21 	Now, the Eternal cries, bring
    your case forward, now, Jacob’s King cries, state your proofs.
        22 	Let us hear what happened in
    the past,
    that we may ponder it, or show me what is yet to b<?, that we may watch how it turns out;
        23 	yes, let us hear what is coming,
    that we may be sure you are gods;
    come, do something or other that we may marvel at the sight!—
        24 	why, you are things of naught,
    you can do nothing at all!
        25 	Here is one I have raised from
    the north,
    I have called him by name from the east;
    he shall trample rulers down like mortar,
    like a potter treading clay.
        26 	Now, who predicted this before­
    hand,
    who foretold it, that we might hail it true?
    No one predicted it, no one an­nounced it,
    not a word ever fell from you.
        27 	’Twas I who first sent word of it
    to Sion,
    ’twas I who sent the good news to Jerusalem.
        28 	As for your idols, I see no one,
    not a prophet in their midst, to answer my inquiries!
        29 	They are all an empty nothing,
    all they do is utterly inane, their metal images are futile, vain.

    Here is my servant whom Iin uphold,
    my chosen one, my heart’s de­light;
    I have endowed him with my spirit,
    to carry true religion to the nations.
    He shall not be loud and noisy, 2 he shall not shout in public;
    he shall not crush a broken reed, 3 nor quench a wick that dimly
    bums;
    loyally shall he set forth true religion,
    he shall not be broken nor 4 grow dim,
    till he has settled true religion upon earth,
    till far lands long for his in­struction.
    Here is the message of the Eter- 5 nal, the true God, who spread and stretched the heavens,
    who made the earth and all it
    bears,
    who gives breath to its people and life to those who walk on it:
    “I the Eternal have called you 6 of set purpose,
    I have taken you by the hand,
    I have formed you for the res­cuing oh my people, for a light to nations,
    to open eyes that are blind, 7 to free captives from their bondage,
    darkened lives from prison.
    I am the Eternal, the true 8 God:
    that, that is my name;
    I yield my glory to none other, my praise to no mere idol.
    My former predictions have now 9 come to pass,
    and now I foretell new things;
    ere ever they spring up,
        I 	tell you of them.”
    * * *
        5 	Sing a new song to the Eternal,
    sing his praise from end to end of earth;
    let the sea and all within it shout,
    far lands and all their folk;
        6 	let the wolds and their town­
    ships rejoice,
    villagers in their settlements; let dwellers in the rock exult, with shouts from the hill­tops!
        13 	The Eternal sallies out like a
    hero,
    stirring his fury like a man of war;
    he lifts aloud his battle-cry, he proves his prowess on his foes.
        14 	“For long I have said not a word, I have restrained myself,
    but now will I break out, like a woman in labour, panting and gasping;
        15 	mountains and hills I will lay
    waste,
    drying up all their herbage, rivers I will turn to dry land, pools of water I will empty;
        16 	and I will bring the blind upon
    their way,
    guiding them by paths they never knew,
        I 	will turn darkness into light before them, rough places into a plain.
    This will I do, I promise,
        I 	will not leave it undone.
        13 	Shame shall cover all who trust
    in carved idols,
    who say to metal images, ‘You are our gods/
    .go Ah, here is a people with 8	eyes—and blind,
    with ears—and deaf!
    a e\ Listen, O ye deaf,
        14 	look up and see, ye blind!

    Who is as blind as my devotee, as blind as the Eternal’s serv­ant?]]
    You have marked nothing, for 20 all you have seen, you have not heard, although your ears were open.
    [[The_ Eternal was pleased, for 21 his own purposes, to render his law great and glorious.]]
    Though the people are all snared 22 in holes,
    hidden away in prison, with none to rescue as they are ravaged,
    with none to deliver as they are despoiled,
    which of you has an ear for what 23 I say,
    and who in days to come will listen, when I cry,
    ‘Who let Jacob be plundered, 24 and Israel be robbed, who vented upon them his 25 burning anger and fierceness like a flame, scorching them, though they knew not why,
    burning them, though they heeded not’?”
    But now, the Eternal promises, he who created you, O Jacob, he who made you, O Israel, “Fear not, for I redeem you,
        I 	claim you, you are mine.
        I 	will be with you when you 2 pass through waters, no rivers shall overflow yop; when you pass through fire, you shall not be scorched, no flames shall burn you.
    For I the Eternal am your God, 3 Israel’s Majestic One is your deliverer;
        I 	will sacrifice Egypt for you,
    Ethiopia and Sabsea for your sake;
        2 	so precious are you to me,
    so honoured, so beloved,
    I will sacrifice lands for you, and nations instead of you.
        3 	From the far east will I bring
    your offspring,
    and from the far west I will gather you,
        4 	I will bid the north lands give
    them up,
    and bid the south let go, bringing my sons from afar, and my daughters from the end of the earth,
        5 	all whom I claim as mine,
    whom I have formed and fashioned for my glory.
    9 Muster all the nations, assemble every race!
    Which of them can offer such a promise,
    such predictions?
    Let them bring their witnesses to prove them right, that we may hear and answer, ‘It is true.’
    10	You are my trusty witnesses, the servants I have chosen, to own me, to believe me, to see that I am ever the same;
    no god was formed before me, nor shall be after me;
    11. I, I am the Eternal,
    there is no saviour besides me.
        5 	’Twas I who promised to save,
    I who fulfilled what I foretold, I and no foreign god among you—
    you are my trusty witnesses to that.
        6 	brom of old I am God,
    and from henceforth the same;
    no one can snatch out of my hand,
    and what I do none can re­verse.”
    The Eternal, your deliverer, 14 Israel’s Majestic One, de­clares:
    “For your sake I send an army against Babylon, and hustle the Chaldeans down the stream, all flying in their pleasure- boats—
    I the Eternal, your Majestic 15 One,
    Israel’s Maker, your own King, opening a road through the sea, 16 a path amid the mighty waters,
    leading out chariots and horses, 17 an army with its warriors, till they drop down and never rise,
    till they are stamped out like a spark.
    Yet think not of the far past, 18 dwell not on deeds of old; here is a new deed of mine	19
    springing to light—have you no eyes for it?
    I open a road through the desert,
    and rivers in a dry place, till the very wild beasts drink 20 to my honour, jackals and ostriches!
    [[For I grant water in the desert,
    and rivers in a dry place, to let my chosen people drink, that they may sound my 21 praise,
    the people I have formed for myself.]]
    And yet, O Jacob, you have 22 not invoked me, you have not troubled about me, O Israel;
    you have not brought me lambs 23 to burn,
    nor honoured me with sacri­fice;
    for I never burdened you with offerings,
    I never wearied you for in­cense.
        24 	You have not bought sweet
    cane for me,
    you have not filled me with rich meat of sacrifice.
    No, you have burdened me with sins,
    and wearied me with your ini­quities.
        25 	[[Yet it is I who (for my own
    sake) blot out your ill deeds, I put your sins out of my mind;
        26 	recall to me, in your defence,
    a single item proving you in­nocent!]]
        27 	Your first father Jacob sinned,
    your prophets turned against me,
        28 	your princes profaned my
    sanctuary;
    so I abandoned Jacob to de­struction,
    Israel to be reviled.
    But now, my servant Jacob, my chosen Israel, listen:
        O 	here is the promise of the Eter­
    nal who made you, your helper from your birth.
    Fear not, O my servant Jacob,
    O Jeshurun, whom I chose,
        1 	for I pour water on the thirsty
    land
    and streams on the dry ground,
    I pour my spirit on your chil­dren,
    my blessing on your offspring,
        2 	till they spring up like grass
    among the waters, like willows by a water-course.
        3 	One shall say, ‘I am the Eter­
    nal’s,’ •
    another shall call himself ‘Jacob,’
    another shall mark his hand ‘The Eternal’s,’
    and be honoured with ‘Is­rael’ as a surname.”
    Here is the word of the Eternal, 6 King of Israel,
    Israel’s deliverer, the Lord of hosts:
    “I am the first and I am the last-
    there is no god besides me,
    Who is like me? Let him come 7 forward with his claim, let him set out his case before me.
    Who foretold the future long ago?
    Pray let us hear what is still to be!
    Fear nothing, dread not in the 8 days to come;
    have I not foretold it and an­nounced it long ago?
    You are my witnesses whether there is any god, any Power, any, besides me. Remember this, O Jacob,	21
        O 	Israel, my witness;
    you are my servant, I made you—
    O Israel, you will not re­nounce me?
    I have swept aside your ill 22 deeds like a mist, and your sins like a cloud,
        1 	have redeemed you; oh re­turn to me!”
    Sing, O heavens, for the Eternal 23 has done it,
    shout aloud, O earth below, burst into song, ye mountains, ye forests and all trees!
    For the Eternal has redeemed Jacob,
    gaining honour to himself by Israel.
    [[Makers of idols are all inane, 9 and their adored images are futile; an idol’s devotees are blind and dull, their end is shame. Who would ever carve a 10
    god or cast an idol?—mere fu­ll tilities! The spells put on it make a sorry show, and its magic charms are only man­made; let its adherents gather, let them come forward, and they shall quake, they shall at
        4 	once be disconcerted. The blacksmith works with the coals and hammers the idol into shape, plying his brawny arms, losing strength as he grows hungry, and weary for a drink
        5 	of water. The worker in wood draws lines on the block, mark­ing them with a pencil; then he shapes the idol with his plane into a human figure, comely as
        6 	a man, to occupy a shrine. In cutting timber for this purpose a man will fix upon some plane or oak, which God planted and the rain nourished to serve as
        7 	fuel; men kindle a fire with it to warm themselves, or start a blaze in order to bake bread. But he turns it into a god for worship; he makes it into an
        8 	idol and bows down to it! Half of it he burns in the fire, roast­ing flesh upon the embers; he eats the roast meat and he is satisfied, warming himself and saying, “Ha, I am warm now,
        9 	I feel the glow!” The other half he turns into a god, into an idol, and bows down to it, worshipping it, praying to it, crying, “Save me, for you are
        10 	my god!” Such men are ig­norant and senseless, their eyes are bedaubed till they cannot see, and their minds closed to
        11 	knowledge; none of them calls to mind—none has sense and wit enough to say to himself, “Half of it I burned in the fire, baking bread upon its embers and roasting meat for food; and am I to make the other half a horrid idol? Am I to bow down
    to a wooden block?” Ashes 20 will satisfy a man who is so duped by a delusion that he cannot pull himself up by ask­ing, “Am I not holding to some­thing false and vain?”]]
    The word of the Eternal your 24 redeemer,
    he who formed you from your birth:
    “I am the Eternal, maker of all things,
    I alone stretched out the heavens,
    ’twas I spread out the earth; who aided me?
    I confound soothsayers and their 25 omens,
    I make diviners mad,
    I foil the sages, turning their wisdom into folly;
    but I am he who carries out 26 his servants’ words, his messengers’ predictions, who says to Jerusalem, Be peo­pled,
    to the temple, Be founded, to Judah’s towns, Be built—
    (for I will raise their ruins); who says to the flood, Be dry— 27 I will parch up your streams; who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my 28 friend,
    he executes my purpose!’
    Thus the Eternal, the true a r* God,	40
    hails Cyrus, whom he conse­crates—
    whose right hand I have grasped,
    to terrify nations, to open doors before him, to keep gates from being closed.
    I myself will go before you, 2 levelling the mountains,
    I will shatter doors of bronze, and cut through iron bars;
        3 	I will give you hidden treasures,
    secret hoards;
    for ’tis I the Eternal who call you by name,
    I the God of Israel.
        4 	For the sake of my servant
    Jacob
    and of my chosen Israel,
    I called you by your name; you know me not, but I de­light in you.
        5 	I am the Eternal; there is no
    one else,
    no God besides me: kings I disarm, but you I arm,
        6 	that, east and west,
    men may confess that I the Eternal stand alone— no god besides me—
        7 	I form light and I make dark­
    ness,
    I bring bliss and calamity;
    I the Eternal, the true God,
    I do it all.
        8 	Shower down victory, ye heav­
    ens,
    rain it from above, ye skies! Let earth’s womb open for the birth of peace, and let her too bear victory—
    ’tis I, the Eternal, who bring this about.
        9 	Woe to the man who quarrels
    with his Maker— man a mere potsherd of the earth!
    Does the clay ask the potter what he is doing? does what he makes tell him that he is powerless?
        10 	[[Woe to him who asks his
    father what he is begetting, or his mother what she is bearing!]]
        11 	And would you question me
    about the future?
    Would you dictate to me about my work?
    says the Eternal, Israel’s maker, Israel’s Majestic One,
    I, I who made the earth,	is
    I who created man on earth,
    I who stretched out the heavens with my own hands,
    I who ordered all their host!
    ’Tis I who have raised Cyrus of 13 set purpose,
    smoothing the path for him;
    ’tis he who shall rebuild my city,
    and set free my exiles.”
    The Lord of hosts declares:	14
    “Exiles from Egypt, captives from Ethiopia, tall Sabaeans too, shall pass before you, bowing down to you, in supplication, saying,
    ‘God is among you only, be­sides him
    there is no god at all.
    Yours is indeed the God of 15
    mystery,
    a God who saves.
    Shamed and disgraced	16
    are all his rivals; and they depart disgraced, who fashion idols; while Israel is saved by the 17 Eternal
    in a lasting triumph.’
    You never shall be shamed, never disgraced, world without end.”
    For this is the message of the 18 Eternal, the true God,
    who formed the earth and fash­ioned it,
    who fixed it firm, made it no waste, but for inhabitants—
    “I am the Eternal, there is no god besides me:
    I never spoke in secret,	19
    in dark corners,
    I never bade the sons of Jacob
    grope for me blindly;
    I the Eternal promise what is true,
    I predict honestly.
        4 	Gather together and come
    hither,
    ye who survive from the na­tions.
    Senseless are all who carry carved idols of wood, praying to gods that cannot save!
        5 	Let us hear your defence;
    consult what you can urge. Who foretold all this of old?
    Who announced it long ago? Was it not I, the Eternal,
    I God alone,
    an upright God, a saviour?— besides me there is no god.
        6 	Turn to me and you are saved,
    all ends of the earth!
    As I am God and God alone,
        7 	I swear by myself,
    I swear a true word,
    never to be recalled, that every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue swear loy­alty.
        8 	Jacob wins victory and power
    by the Eternal only; all who were enraged at him shall be defeated and dis­graced,
        15 	but all the sons of Israel shall triumph
    and exult in the Eternal.
    Bel crouches, Nebo cowers; their idols become bales for beasts,
    lifted and laid on weary cattle!
        0 	They crouch and cower, these
    gods together.
    They to rescue their loads? They are themselves bundled into captivity!
        1 	Listen to me, O household of
    Jacob,
    all who are left of Israel’s household,
    my load since ever you were borne,
    whom I have carried since your mother bore you; even to your old age I will be 4 the same,
    when you are grey-haired, still I will sustain you;
    I have borne the burden, I will carry it,
    yes, I will carry you and save you.
    To whom then can you liken 5 me and equal me, and compare me as an equal? [[Those who empty bags of gold 6 and weigh out silver, hire a goldsmith to make a god of it,
    then bow down and worship
    it;
    they shoulder it and put it in 7 its place;
    where it stands, it never moves;
    it never answers any cry for help,
    it never saves a man from trouble.
    Remember that, pay heed to it, 8 lay it to heart, you rebels!]] Remember the far past	9 for I am God alone,
    I am God and there is none like me,
    I who foretell the end from the 10 beginning,
    and from of old what is to be, saying, ‘My purpose shall stand,
    I carry out whate’er I choose,’ summoning a bird of prey from 11 the east,
    a man for my purpose from a land afar;
    I have said it, I will do it,
    I will carry out my plan.
    Listen, ye who are downcast, 13 who feel far from any tri­umph,
    13 I bring my triumph near, right near,
    my victory is hastening;
    I will grant Sion victory, and Israel the glory that is mine.
    * * *
    Down with you, sit in the dust,
        O 	maiden Babylon!
    No throne for you, sit on the ground, lady Chaldea!
    Never shall you be again dainty and delicate.
        2 	Grind meal at the hand-mill,
    off with your veil!
    Strip your skirts, unbare your thighs,
    wade through the streams.
        3 	For I am taking vengeance, I
    will not relent,
        4 	says our Deliverer;
    the Lord of hosts is his name.
        5 	Sit silent in the dark,
    lady Chaldea!
    Never again shall you be queen, a mistress over realms.
        6 	When in anger with my people
        O 	let my own land be defiled, putting them into your power,
    you had no pity on them; you pressed your heavy yoke even on the aged;
        2 	you thought that you would
    last for ever, mistress for all time, you thought nothing of your cruelty,
    reckless of all it would bring.
        3 	So listen to this, you luxurious
    creature,
    lolling at your ease, thinking to yourself,
    ‘I am supreme, never shall I be widowed, never suffer loss of children’;
        4 	both sorrows shall befall you
    in a moment, on one day, widowhood and loss of children, they are on you suddenly,
    in spite of all your spells, and mighty magic, though you feared nothing in 10 your tyranny,
    thinking that no one saw you.
    It was your own magic craft and cunning
    that misled you, till you thought to yourself ‘I am supreme.’
    Therefore shall evil assail you, 11 that you know no spells to avert,
    and mischief shall befall you, you cannot ward from you, and a sudden crash of ruin, you know not how to evade.
    Go on with your spells!	12
    Practise aU your magic arts! Perhaps you will make some­thing of them,
    perhaps be able to scare off your foes!
    You have worn yourself out 13 with them all;
    let the astrologers come for­ward now,
    let the star-gazers save you now,
    who calculate the future, month by month!
    They fare no better than the 14 straw
    burned by a fire; they cannot save their own lives
    from the flames of war.
    And that is all you find the 15 men for whom
    you spent yourself from youth! Away they stagger scattering, all of them,
    and there is none to save you.
    Listen to this, O house- a q hold of Jacob	4rO
    [[you who are called by the name of Israel, the issue of Jacob, who swear by the name of the Eternal,
    and celebrate the God of Is­rael,
    but insincerely and dishon­estly.
        0 	They call themselves members
    of the sacred city, relying on the God of Israel, whose name is the Lord of hosts!]],
        1 	what has occurred I foretold
    long ago;
    it fell from my lips, I predicted it,
    then suddenly I acted—it was done.
        2 	[[Knowing you were obstinate,
    stiff-necked as iron, with a brazen brow,]]
        3 	I foretold it to you long ago,
    I let you see it ere ever it occurred
    [[lest you should say, ‘My idol did it,
    my carved image, my metal god brought it about’]].
        4 	You heard it all, you know it,
    and will you not bear witness? Now I am showing you new things,
    secrets that you never knew,
        5 	things created now, not long
    ago,
    things you never heard of till this hour
    [[lest you should say, I knew them]].
        6 	You never heard of them nor
    knew them,
    I revealed nothing to you then
    [[knowing how faithless you are, utterly,
    how you have been rebellious from your birth.
        7 	For my own honour I defer my
    anger,
    I gain praise for my pity, sparing you;
    10	I purged you, nothing came of it, testing you in the furnace, all in vain]].
    I do this for the sake of my 11 own honour
    [[alas, how sullied it is!]],
    I will not yield my glory to another.
    Listen to me, Jacob,	12
    Israel whom I have called:
    I am evermore the same,
    I am the first and I the last;
    my hand laid the foundations 13 of the earth,
    my right hand spread the skies above;
    whenever I call them, they answer to the summons.
    Gather, all of you, and listen:	14
    which of your idols ever pre­dicted this,
    that my friend Cyrus should work out my will on Babylon and the Chaldean line?
    I foretold it, ’twas I called him, 13 ’twas I brought him, I have prospered him.
    From the first I made no secret 16 of it;
    ever since it began, I have been in it.
    This is the word of the Eternal 17 your deliverer, the Majestic One of Israel:
    I am the Eternal your God, training you for your good, leading you by the right way.
    If only you would listen to my 18 orders,
    you_ would have bliss brim­ming like a river, and welfare ample as the ocean waves,
    your offspring would be like the 19 sands in number, your children numberless as grains of dust,
    your name would never die, never be lost out of my land.”
    Leave Babylon, oh come away, 20 away from the Chaldeans!
    Sing this aloud, proclaim it, shout to the ends of the earth, that the Eternal now delivers Jacob his servant!
    21 Through deserts he led them, and they never thirsted; for them he made water flow out of the rocks, he split up a boulder and water poured out.
    Listen to me, shores afar, distant races, hearken! The Eternal called me from my birth,
    singled me out from my mother’s lap.
        2 	He put a sharp edge on my
    words,
    and covered me safe with his hand;
    he made me a polished arrow, and stored me in his quiver,
        3 	telling me, “You are my servant,
    Israel,
    by whom I will gain honour.” 5 So I gained honour in the Eter­nal’s eyes,
    and my God was my strength.
        4 	I thought I had been labouring
    in vain,
    spending my strength for nothing;
    “But surely,” said I, “the Eter­nal will do me justice, my God will see to my re­ward.”
    3 And the Eternal who had formed me from my birth to serve him in restoring Jacob, in gathering Israel back to him, 3 the Eternal now says, “ ’Tis too slight a service to set the clans of Jacob up again,
    and restore Israel’s survivors; I now appoint you to bring light to the nations,
    that my salvation may reach the world’s end.”
    A message from the Eternal, 7 from Israel’s deliverer, Israel’s Majesty,
    to one scorned openly, whom na­tions loathe,
    whom tyrants hold in thrall:
    “Kings shall start up at the sight of you,
    kings and princes shall do homage,
    since the Eternal aids you loy­ally,
    and Israel’s Majesty has chosen you.
    For when the favouring hour 8 comes, I will answer you, and aid you when the day for rescue dawns,
    restoring the ruined land, re-peopling desolate places,
    bidding exiles leave their prison 9 and captives come forth to the light.”
    On the road home, food shall never fail them, they shall find pasture even upon bare hills;
    they shall not hunger, neither 10 shall they thirst, never shall sun or sirocco plague them;
    for he who pities them shall lead them,
    guiding them to springs of water.
    “I will make a highroad of the 11 hills,
    and level every height for them.”
    There they are coming, some 12 from afar,
    some from the north and the western sea,
    some from the south-land of Syene!
    Shout for joy, O heavens, re- 13 joice, O earth!
    O hills, burst into song!
    For the Eternal has consoled his people
    and pitied his forlorn folk.
        5 	“The Eternal has forsaken me,”
    says Sion,
    “my Lord has forgotten me.”
        6 	Can a woman forget her infant,
    forget to pity her babe?
    Yet even were a mother to for­get,
    never will I forget you.
        7 	Look, Sion, I have printed your
    walls plain
    on both my hands!— your ruins are before me all the time.
        8 	Men are making haste to build
    you:
    those who ravaged, those who ruined,
    now withdraw from you.
        9 	Look round you, look, your folk
    are flocking in,
    coming to you! I swear it by my life—
    the Eternal promises, you shall have them to adorn yourself,
    and girdle yourself like a bride.
        10 	As for your ruins and desolate
    places,
    your ravaged land, it shall be too small then to hold your citizens,
    once your invaders have been driven afar;
        11 	your exiles shall one day
    be calling out to you,
    “The, land here is too small to hold us,
    give us more room”;
    3t and you shall say to yourself, “Now, who bore me all these children?
    I am childless, I am barren; who can have reared these for me?
    I have been left all alone; can these be really mine?”
    22 The Lord declares:
    *'1 beckon to the nations,
    I signal to the peoples,
    to bring your sons clasped in their arms,
    to bear your daughters on their shoulders.
    Kings shall be their guardians; 23 queens shall nurse them for you;
    they shall do homage to you, faces on the ground, and grovel in the dust before your feet.
    Then shall you learn that I am the Eternal,
    that none who look to me are disappointed.”
    “But can a strong man’s prey 24 be snatched away?
    Can prisoners of a tyrant ever escape?”
    “Yes, prisoners may be snatched 25 even from a strong man, even the prey of tyrants may escape.
    I will maintain your cause, and your sons I will rescue,
    forcing your foes to prey upon 26 themselves,
    to drink their own blood and be drunk.
    Then shall the whole world learn that it is I
    who saves you, I the Eter­nal.”
    The Eternal, your deliverer, the Eternal, Jacob’s CTfk Hero, asks,	Ovr
    “What writ of divorce did I ever hand
    to your mother?
    When did I ever part with you and sell you to some creditor?
    ’Twas for your evil doings you were sold,
    ’twas for your sins your mother was divorced.
    Why was there no one when I 2 came,


    no one to answer, when I called?
    Think you, my hand is too weak to deliver, that I have no power to re­lease you?
    With one word of rebuke I dry the sea,
    I turn streams into desert land,
    till the fish shrivel for the lack of water,
    till the sea-creatures gasp and die for thirst;
        3 	I shroud the skies in mourn­
    ing,
    and cover them with sack­cloth.”
    * * *
        4 	The Lord, the Eternal, has
    given me
    a well-trained tongue, that I may rightly answer the ungodly;
    morning by morning he awak­ens me
    to learn my lesson,
        5 	and never have I disobeyed,
    or turned away.
        6 	I let them lash my back,
    and pluck my beard out;
    I never hid my face from shame and spitting.
        7 	The Lord, the Eternal, he will
    help me;
    so I am not confounded,
    I set my face like a flint, knowing that I shall not be put to shame.
        8 	He who will vindicate me is at
    hand;
    who dare oppose me?
    Side by side let us stand.
    Who dares to charge me?
    Let him draw near.
        9 	The Lord, the Eternal, he will
    help me;
    who then can worst me?
    They shall all go to pieces like a robe,
    consumed by moths.
    [[Whoever of you reveres the 10 Eternal,
    listen to his servant’s voice:— whoever is walking in the dark, without a ray of light, let him have confidence in the Eternal,
    and lean upon his God.
    But you who kindle strife,	11
    who set the world ablaze, begone to your flames, all of you,
    to the firebrands you have lighted!
    This is your fate from me, to lie in torments.]]
    “Listen to me, all ye who ("I seek redress,	O-L
    who long for the Eternal’s aid; look at the rock whence you were hewn,
    the quarry you were dug from;
    look at your father Abraham, a with Sarah your own mother!
    He was but one when I called him,
    and I blessed, I increased him.
    Even so the Eternal consoles 3 Sion,
    consoles all her ruins, makes her desert like an Eden, makes her steppes like his own garden;
    joy and gladness shall be found in her,
    thanksgiving and song.
    Listen to me, O my people, 4 hearken, O my nation; the rules of my religion I send forth
    to light up every nation.
    Swift and soon is my redress,
    my victory is dawning; mine arms shall inflict judg­ment on the peoples, but the sea-coasts shall hope in me.
        0 	Look up to the skies above,
    look down upon the earth; for like smoke the skies shall vanish,
    and earth wear out like a robe,
    the world itself shall crumble, and its dwellers die-like gnats; but my deliverance endures for ever,
    my triumph knows no end.
        1 	Listen, all ye who care for the
    good cause,
    O	people who lay my laws to heart!
    Fear not the taunts of men; when they revile you, never be dismayed;
        2 	for they shall be moth-eaten
    like a robe,
    like wool consumed by worms, but my deliverance endures for ever,
    my triumph knows no end.”
        3 	Bestir thyself, O arm of the
    Eternal,
    bestir thyself and don thy might!
    Bestir thyself as in the days of old,
    in ages of the past!
    Didst thou not shatter the Rahab
    and pierce the Dragon through?
    10	Didst thou not once dry up the
    sea,
    the waters of the mighty deep,
    and make the ocean-depths a path
    for ransomed men to pass across?
    “Yes, I am he who comforts ia you;
    how can you ever be afraid of mortal men, of men on earth who like the grass shall fade? Why forget the Eternal One, 13 who made you,
    who spread the skies and set the earth?
    Why tremble all day long at your oppressor’s wrath?
    When he aims to destroy you, what comes of all his wrath? Soon shall captives be set free, 14 they shall not starve to death in prison;
    for I am your God, the Eternal, 15 who can stir the sea to storm: the Lord of hosts is my name,
    [[I put my words into your lips, 16 and hid you in the shadow of my hand,
    when I spread out the skies and set the earth,
    when I told Sion that they were my people.]]”
    Bestir yourself, bestir yourself, 17 rise up, Jerusalem!
    You have had to drink from the Eternal’s hand his cup of indignation, you have had to drain his bowl, that left you staggering.
    [[She has none to guide her, 18 none of all her children; none to take her by the hand, of all the sons she reared.]]
    Yours is a twofold trouble—	10
    and who has pity on you?— wreck and ruin, want and war: whoever can console you?
    Your sons lay swooning,	20
    like antelopes within a net, drunk full with the Eternal’s fury,
    with your God’s rebuke.
    Poor, prostrate one, o’ercome 21 but not with wine,
    listen to this now,
        13 	from your Husband the Eter­
    nal, from your God, who takes the part of his people:
    “I have removed from you the cup
    that leaves men staggering, and never shall you drain again my bowl of fury;
        14 	I hand it to your torturers,
    to those who harrowed you, to men who ordered you to bow that they might pass, your very back bent for the feet of men to trample o’er.”
    Bestir yourself, bestir yourself, O Sion, robe yourself with strength!
    O sacred city of Jerusalem, put on your rich apparel!
    For pagans and profane men never more shall enter you.
        2 	Rise, shake the dust from you,
    captive Jerusalem, loosen your shackles now,
    O captive maiden Sion!
        3 	[[For this is what the Eternal declares: “Once you were sold for nothing, and now you shall be freed without any payment.
        4 	My people went down to Egypt at the outset, to live there, and then Assyria oppressed them for
        5 	nothing. Now,” says the Eter­nal, “my people have been car­ried off for nothing, and how doe3 that profit me? Why, my temple is thrown down,” says the Eternal, “my name is con-
        6 	stantly reviled! So my people shall learn on that day who I am, that it is I who made the promise.”]]
        7 	Look! ’tis the feet of a herald, hastening over the hills,
    with glad, good news, with tidings of relief, calling aloud to Sion,
    “Your God reigns!”
    All your sentinels are shouting, 8 in a triumph-song, for they see the Eternal face to face
    as he returns to Sion.
    Break into a song of praise, 9 O ruins of Jerusalem; the Eternal has consoled his people,
    he has freed Jerusalem.
    All nations have seen the Eter- 10 nal bare
    his sacred arm for action, and all ends of the earth shall see
    how our God gains the vic­tory . . .
    Away, away from here;	11
    of things unclean keep clear. Leave the place, purify your­selves,
    to carry the Eternal’s sacred vessels.
    Nor need you hurry forth,	12
    flying like fugitives, for the Eternal goes in front of you,
    and your rear-guard is Is­rael’s God.
    * * *
    Behold, my servant Israel yet 13 shall rise,
    he shall be raised on high; as many were appalled once at 14 his fate,
    kings shuddering at his doom, so many a nation shall yet do 15 him homage, with kings in silent awe, for they shall see what they were never told, a sight unheard of.
    “Who could have be­lieved,” they cry,
    “what we have heard? Whoever had the Eternal’s power
    so revealed to them?
        2 	Why, Israel of old grew like a
    sapling,
    like a shoot springing from dry soil;
    he had no beauty to attract our eyes,
    no charm to make us choose
    him—
    14 disfigured till he seemed a man no more,
    deformed out of the sem­blance of a man.
    C*o He was despised and
        3 	OO shunned by men,
    a man of pain, who knew what sickness was;
    like one from whom men turn with shuddering, he was despised, we took no heed of him.
        4 	And yet ours was the pain he
    bore,
    the sorrow he endured!
    We thought him suffering from a stroke
    at God’s own hand;
        5 	yet he was wounded because we
    had sinned,
    ’twas our misdeeds that crushed him;
    ’twas for our welfare that he was chastised,
    the blows that fell to him have brought us healing.
        6 	Like sheep we had all gone
    astray,
    we had each taken his own way,
    and on him the Eternal laid the guilt of all of us.
        7 	He was ill-treated, yet he bore it
    humbly,
    he never would complain, dumb as a sheep led to the slaughter,
    dumb as a ewe before the shearers.
    They did away with him un- 8 justly;
    and who heeded how he fell, torn from the land of the living, struck down for sins of ours? They laid him in a felon’s grave, 9 and buried him with criminals, though he was guilty of no vio­lence,
    nor had he uttered one false word.
    But the Eternal chose to vindi- 10 cate his servant, rescuing his life from anguish; he let him prosper to the full, in a posterity with life pro­longed.”
    Yes, many shall hold my servant 11 blameless,
    since ’twas their guilt he bore.
    Therefore shall he win victory, 12 he shall succeed triumphantly, since he has shed his life-blood, and let himself be numbered among rebels,
    bearing the great world’s sins, and interposing for rebellious men.
    * * *
    O	barren soul, who never ef A bore, sing songs!
    Break into song, O childless one!
    For when she is forlorn, she has more sons
    than when she was wedded.
    Widen the place for your tent, 2 spare not your canvas, stretch it out;
    lengthen your ropes, drive in your tent-pegs.
    Widen the place for your tent, 3 for you shall spread to south and north;
    your sons shall take possession of the nations,
    and people towns now deso­late.
        0 	Fear not, you never shall be put
    to shame;
    be not confused, you shall not be confounded;
    your early shame you shall for­get,
    the taunts when you were cast aside;
        1 	for your husband is your Maker,
    the Lord of hosts his name; your redeemer is His Majesty of Israel,
    the God of all the earth.
        2 	The Eternal recalls you like a
    wife
    broken-hearted by neglect; “But a young wife”—your God asks—
    “how can she be thrown aside?
        3 	I did forsake you for awhile,
    but I will take you back right tenderly;
        4 	I did turn from you in a rush of
    wrath,
    but with a lasting love I pity you:
    so promises the Eternal your redeemer.
        5 	’Tis like the days of Noah; for as then I swore
    that Noah’s waters should flood earth no more, so now I swear that nevermore will I rebuke you in my wrath.
        6 	Though mountains be removed,
    and hills be shaken, never shall my love leave you, my compact for your welfare shall stand firm: so promises the Eternal in his pity.
        7 	Poor storm-tossed soul, discon­
    solate,
        I 	will build you up on jewels.
    and make sapphires your foun­dation;
    I will make ramparts out of 12 rubies,
    gates for you of crystals, and all your walls of gems;
    the Eternal will train all your 13 builders,
    and prosper your sons mightily; your triumph shall be stable. 14
    Oppression shall be far from you,
    and nothing need you fear;
    ruin shall be remote from you,
    it never shall come near.
    Should strife be stirred, ’tis not 15 by me;
    whoever falls on you shall fall to ruin.
    ’Tis I, I make the smith	16
    who heats his furnace, and fashions weapons by his craft;
    ’tis I who make destroyers to destroy.
    No weapon forged against you 17 shall succeed,
    no tongue raised against you shall win its plea.
    Such is the lot of the Eternal’s servants;
    thus, the Eternal promises, do I maintain their cause.”
    “Ah come, all ye that eft? thirst, come to the wa- ters,
    come, eat, O fainting souls!
    Buy food for nothing,
    wine and milk without money! Why spend your money on what 2 is not food,
    your earnings on what never satisfies?
    Listen to me, oh listen, and you shall feed on good,
    and thrill over the finest fare.
        3 	Hearken to me, come to me,
    listen and you shall revive; by an eternal compact I grant you
    the favours promised faith­fully to David;
        4 	for as I once made him a witness
    to the world,
    the leader and commander of the nations,
        5 	so now shall you call foreign folk,
    and strangers shall come hurrying to you,
    all for the sake of your God the Eternal,
    of Israel’s Majesty who has honoured you.
        6 	Seek the Eternal while he may
    be found,
    call to him while he is near.
        7 	[[Let guilty men give up their
    ways,
    and evil men their purposes; let them turn back to the Eter­nal,
    who will pity them, turn back to our God, for he will pardon them abun­dantly.]]
        8 	For my plans are not like your
    plans,
    nor your ways like my ways— so the Eternal One declares;
        9 	nay, as heaven is higher than
    the earth,
    so are my ways higher than your ways,
    and my plans than your plans.
        10 	As rain and snow from heaven
    fall not in vain, but water earth until it yields seed for the sower, food for hungry men,
        11 	so with the promise that has
    passed my lips: it falls not fruitless and in vain,
    but works out what I will, and carries out my purpose.
    For you shall leave with joy, 12 and be led off in blissful bands;
    the hills shall burst before you into song,
    and all trees clap their hands;
    fir-trees shall grow instead of 13 thorns,
    myrtles instead of nettles;
    and all this shall redound to the Eternal’s fame, a lasting monument that
    never ends.”
    * * *
    This is the word of the r jT Eternal:	OvJ
    “Hold to religion and do what is right,
    for my deliverance is at hand, my triumph will be soon in sight.
    Happy the man who does my 2 bidding,
    happy the mortal who holds to it,
    who keeps the sabbath and pro­fanes it not,
    who keeps his hand off any evil deed!
    Let not your foreigner say, 3 ‘The Eternal will excommuni­cate me’;
    let not your eunuchs say,
    ‘Ah, we are but a barren tree.’
    For this is the Eternal’s word: 4 eunuchs who keep my sab­baths,
    who choose what I approve, and hold fast to my com­pact,
    theirs is a monument within my 5 temple
    nobler than any sons or daughters,
    a memorial from myself that never shall be moved!
    Foreigners who join the Eternal, 6
    to worship him and love him,
    serving him, men and women,
    keeping the sabbath unpro­faned,
        2 	them will I bring to my own
    sacred hill,
    and make them joyful in my house of prayer;
    their offerings and sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar there;
    my temple shall be called a house of prayer for every nation.
        3 	Here is what the Lord the Eter­
    nal says,
    who gathers Israel’s outcasts in: I will yet gather others in,
    besides those I have gathered. * * *
        4 	Wild beasts in field and forest,
    all of you,
    come hither and devour your prey!
    10	My watchmen are all blind,
    they know not how to guard; dumb dogs, every one of them, they cannot bark— there they lie, a-dreaming, in the sleep they love.
    xi Yes, and greedy dogs are they, never satisfied, each bent on his own, each set on his gains;
        3 	‘Come, fetch the wine,
    Let’s swill our fill!’ they say; ‘And to-morrow will be a rare time too, a royal day!’
    Meanwhile the good man dies,
    and no one heeds it; pious men are perishing, and no one cares.
    The evil of the day kills off good men;
        2 	they enter peace, for only in the grave can upright men
    ever find rest.
    * * *
    Step forward, you,	3
    you sons of sorcery, brood born of harlots and adul­terers;
    at whom are you jeering,	4
    at whom are you sneering, putting your tongues out?
    What are you but apostates, a disloyal brood,
    inflaming your passions at an 5 oak,
    under a green tree, and sacrificing children in the glen,
    between the rocky cliffs?
    You choose the slippery gods of 6 the glen,
    you settle to have them!
    To them you pour out your liba­tions
    and offer cereals!
    [[Am I to leave all that un­punished?]]
    You spread your couch	7
    high on a lofty hill, and thither you went up to sacrifice.
    You set up your foul symbol too 8 behind the door-posts and the door;
    before it you would strip and lie, embraced in bed, buying embrace upon embrace, from men for hire, as the foul symbol stirred your foul desire.
    For Molek you perfumed your- 9 self,
    with scent on scent; you made your messengers go far,
    even to the gods below.
    You wearied yourselves out,	10
    but never would you give up; your strength revived, you would not cease, you went on fearlessly,	11
    in faithlessness, giving no thought to me.
    in your indifference.
    Is it not so? I said no word,
        I 	hid my face from you, and on you went, fearing me not.
        0 	But I will expose your doings,
    this ‘religion’ of yours!
        1 	Your loathsome idols, when you
    cry,
    will bring you neither help nor gain;
    the wind shall whirl them all away,
    a breath shall blow them off. But they who trust in me shall hold the land
    and own my sacred hills.”
    * * *
        2 	Bank up a causeway, clear a
    path,
    remove stones from my peo­ple’s way.
        3 	For he who is high and uplifted,
    the Majestic One, he who sits enthroned for evermore, declares:
    “I sit on high, enthroned, the Majestic One,
    and I am with the crushed and humbled soul,
    to revive the spirit of the humble,
    and to put heart into the crushed.
        4 	I will not afflict for ever,
        I 	will not be always wroth; for then man’s spirit would give way before me, the very souls that I had made.
        0 	Their sins have made me angry
    for a while,
        I 	struck them in my wrath and turned away; and they went on, wilful, re­bellious.
        0 	I marked them,” the Eternal
    says.
    “But now I heal them, I will give them rest,
    and recompense them with all consolation,
    till I make their mourners loud 19
    in thanks,
    when far and near alike fare prosperously.
    Ungodly men are like the rest- 20
    less sea,
    that never can be still, whose waters throw up dirt and
    mire;
    no prosperous peace for the 21 ungodly,” says my God.
    “Cry out, spare not your rfO voice,	OO
    raise it loud as a trumpet, and let my people hear their sins,
    let Jacob’s household hear their guilt.
    Daily indeed they turn to me, 2 it is their joy to learn my rites,
    as any nation might that held religion,
    true to the orders of its God!
    They ask me to direct them, they delight in worship,
    they ask me why I never mark 3 their fasts,
    nor pay heed to their pen­ances!
    Why, on fast days you find time for your business, you go collecting debts!
    Fasting makes you fretful, quar- 4 relsome,
    till you strike ungodly blows.
    Fasting like yours to-day	5
    will never bear your prayers on high.
    Would I choose such a fast, such penances?
    To droop your head like a bul­rush,
    to lie in sackcloth and ashes—
    is that what you call ‘fasting,’
    a day the Eternal would approve?
        2 	Is not this my chosen fast,
    the Lord, the Eternal, asks, to loosen all that fetters men unfairly,
    and to relax its grip,
    to free poor debtors from their bonds,
    and break what binds them?
        3 	It is to share your food with
    hungry men,
    and take the homeless to your home,
    to clothe the naked when you see them,
    and never turn from any fellow-creature.
        4 	Then shall light dawn for you,
    with healing for your wounds;
    you shall advance, your good­ness in the van, and the Eternal’s glory as your rear-guard;
        5 	the Eternal will answer when
    you call,
    and, when you cry, he will say, ‘Here am I!’
    If you will do away with all oppression,
    with open scorn and words of malice,
        6 	if you bestow your bread upon
    the hungry,
    and relieve men in misery,
    then light shall dawn for you in
    darkness,
    your dull hour shall be bright as noon,
        7 	and evermore shall the Eternal
    guide you,
    guarding you without fail;
    he will refresh you in dry places, and renew your strength, till you are like a watered garden,
    like an oasis with a steadfast spring.
    Your sons shall build once more 12 the ancient ruins, and old foundations you shall raise again;
    you shall be called the repairer of ruins,
    the restorer of wrecked homes.
    * * *
    If you refrain from doing your 13 own business
    upon the sabbath, on my sacred day,
    and hold the sabbath a de­light,
    and the Eternal’s sacred day an honour,
    not following your own wonted round,
    not doing business, and not talking idly,
    then you shall have delight in 14 the Eternal’s favour,
    for he will let you hold the land in triumph,
    enjoying your father Jacob’s heritage:
    so the Eternal himself prom­ises.”
    * * *
    The Eternal’s hand is not too short to save, the Eternal’s ear is not too dull to hear!
    It is your own iniquities that : interfere
    between your God and you; your sins have made him veil his face from you, until he will not listen.
    For your hands are stained with , blood,
    your fingers stained with crime; lies fall from your lips, your tongues are muttering malicious wrong; in court no one sues honestly, no plea is just;
    pretence and falsehood you rely on,
    big with mischief, you bear mischief.
        2 	Intriguers, they hatch basilisk’s
    eggs,
    and weave a spider’s web; eat their eggs, and you die, crush one, out crawls a viper!
        3 	What they weave covers no
    one,
    what they concoct clothes no one;
    ’tis violence they have in hand.
        4 	Their feet run fast to crime,
    they hurry to murder inno­cent men;
    their thoughts are thoughts of mischief,
    rapine and ruin are the track they follow;
        5 	they care not for what leads to
    bliss,
    their paths are void of justice; they take the crooked course, where bliss is all unknown.
        6 	So we are far from having our
    wrongs righted, we come by no redress; we look for light, but all is dark, we look for gleams, and walk in gloom;
        7 	we grope, like a blind man along
    the wall,
    we feel our way, like sightless men;
    at noon we stumble, as in twi­light,
    we live in darkness like the dead.
        8 	We are all moaning like a bear,
    mourning low like doves; we long to be righted, all in vain, no rescue is in sight for us.
        9 	For our transgressions before
    thee are many,
    and our sins testify against us,
    transgressions that are ever in our minds, sins we know well— rebellions, treachery to the Eter- 13 nal,
    deserting from our God, talking perversely and defiantly, telling lies from our heart.
    Justice has to turn away de- 14 feated,
    right is forced to hold aloof, for truth in our assemblies has no footing,
    honesty cannot enter there; truth is never to be seen,	15
    and moral sense has left the town.
    The Eternal saw this and was angry
    that no justice could be seen. When he saw, and seeing won- 16 dered,
    there was none to intervene, then he put forth his owrn power, sustained by his own passion; he put on might as armour, 17 and victory as a helmet, and vengeance as his clothing, and zeal to be his mantle.
    In strict requital he repays his 18 foes
    with fury and his enemies with shame,
    till in the far west men have awe 19 of the Eternal,
    and in the east they see his brilliant deeds;
    for his vengeance pours out like a pent-up stream, driven by a blast of wind, but to Sion he comes for deliver- 20 ance,
    to free Jacob from its rebels.
    [[As for me, the Eternal de- 21 dares, this is my compact with them: “My spirit which rests upon you, and the words I have
    put into your lips, shall never depart from your lips, nor from the lips of your descendants, nor from the lips of their de­scendants,” the Eternal de­clares, “from henceforth and
    for ever.”]]
    * * *
    Arise, be glad, your light is dawning, the Eternal’s splendour rises upon you.
        2 	Though darkness covers all the
    earth,
    and a black cloud shrouds the nations,
    yet the Eternal shines out upon you,
    his splendour on you gleams,
        3 	till nations gather to your light
    and kings to your bright beams.
        4 	Look round you, look!
    How all are flocking in, your sons from far away, your daughters carried on the arm!
        5 	With radiant face you see them,
    your heart a-thrill and throb­bing;
    for the rich sea-trade shall flow to you,
    and the wealth of nations shall be yours.
        6 	Camels stream across your
    land,
    from Midian and Ephah, trains of camels all from She­ba—
    a testimony to the Eternal’s fame!
        7 	All Kedar’s flocks gather to
    you,
    Nebaioth’s rams shall serve your need—
    a sacrifice I welcome on my altar,
    within my house of prayer so fair.
    Who are these flying like a 8 cloud,
    like doves into their cotes?
    ’Tis ships that gather here to 9 me,
    ships of Tartessus in the van, to bring your sons from far away,
    with all their silver and their gold,
    back to where the Eternal your God dwells,
    to Israel’s Majesty who has honoured you.
    Foreigners shall rebuild your 10 walls,
    their kings shall do you service;
    for though in wrath I struck you down,
    I show you pity now and favour.
    Ever shall your gates lie open, 11
    never shut by day or night, to let the nations pour their wealth in,
    headed by their kings.
    [[For any nation or dynasty 12 that will not serve you shall perish; such nations shall be laid utterly waste.]]
    Lebanon’s glorious cedars shall 13 be yours,
    with pines and planes and cypresses,
    that my sanctuary may be adorned,
    that my footstool may be splendid.
    The sons of those who scorned 14 and humbled you
    shall come to you, all bending low,
    and hail you as “The Eternal’s own city,
    the Sion of Israel’s Majesty.”
    As once you lay forsaken, 15
    shunned and hated,
    so now I make you an eternal pride,
    a joy to all ages.
        16 	You shall suck milk from the
    nations,
    suck even royal breasts; so shall you learn that I the Eternal am your saviour, and Jacob’s Hero your de­liverer.
        17 	Instead of bronze I will bring
    gold to you, silver instead of iron.
    I will appoint Peace as your governor,
    and Justice as your ruler;
        18 	no sound of violence shall be in
    your land,
    nor ruin nor rapine within your borders;
    your ramparts you shall name Protection,
    and your gates Renown.
        19 	The sun shall no more be your
    light by day,
    nor shall the moon shed light on you,
    but your unending light shall be the Eternal,
    your God shall be your splen­dour.
        20 	Your sun shall never set,
    your moon shall never wane, for your unending light shall be the Eternal,
    and mourning days will never come again.
        21 	All your people shall be pious,
    they shall always hold the land,
    planted there by the Eternal’s hand,
    his own work, for his own glory;
        22 	the smallest sept becomes a clan,
    the least grows to a mighty nation.
    I, the Eternal, who have prom­ised this,
    will hasten its due consumma­tion.

    \q1 The Lord Eternal, he inspires me;
    \q2 for the Eternal has consecrated me,
    \q1 and sent me with good news for wretched men,
    \q2 to heal the broken-hearted,
    \q1 to tell prisoners they are free,
    \q2 to tell captives they are released,
    \v 2
    \q1 to proclaim a year of the Eternal’s favour,
    \q2 a day of our God’s vengeance,
    \q1 to console all mourners,
    \v 3
    \q2 to give them coronals for coronachs,
    \q1 oil of joy for mourning robes,
    \q2 praise for plaintiveness;
    \q1 they shall be sturdy oaks of goodness,
    \q2 planted by the Eternal in his honour.
    \v 4
    \q1 They shall rebuild ancient ruins,
    \q2 restoring what has long lain desolate,
    \q1 repairing ruined towns,
    \q2 that have lain waste for ages.

    \v 5
    \q1 The foreigner shall serve you as a herdsman,
    \q2 the alien shall work your fields and vineyards;

    \q1 but you shall be called the Eternal’s priests,
    \q2 your sons shall be the ministers of our God;
    \q1 you shall enjoy the wealth of nations,
    \q2 and deck yourselves out in their splendour.
    \v 7
    \q1 They suffered shame in double measure,
    \q2 abuse and insult were their lot;
    \q1 so now in their own land they shall get double--
    \q2 theirs is a lasting joy.
    \p
    \v 8
    \q1 For I am the Eternal, I love justice,
    \q2 iniquitous harrying I hate;
    \q1 so I will recompense them duly,
    \q2 and make with them a compact that shall last;
    \v 9
    \q1 their sons shall be known in every place,
    \q2 their offspring famous among nations,
    \q1 till all who see them own they are the race
    \q2 that the Eternal blesses.
    \v 11
    \q1 For as the earth brings forth its growth,
    \q2 as seed springs up in gardens,
    \q1 so before all the world will the Lord Eternal
    \q2 bring forth their triumph and renown.
    \c 6
    \p
    For Sion’s sake I will not hold my peace, for Jerusalem’s sake I will never rest,
    till her triumph shines out brilliant,
    and her deliverance like a blazing torch,
        2 	so that the very nations see
    your triumph,
    and every king beholds your splendour.
    You shall be called by a name that is new,
    a name to be fixed by the Eternal.
        3 	A fair crown shall you be, in the
    Eternal’s hand,
    a royal diadem carried by your God.
        4 	“Forsaken” shall no longer be
    your name,
    your land shall no more be called “Desolate”; you shall be “my Delight,” your land shall be “my wed­ded wife,”
    for the Eternal takes delight in
    you,
    and your land shall again be married.
    As a young man weds a maiden, 5 so your Founder marries you, and as a bridegroom thrills to his bride,
    so shall your God thrill to you.
    I have set sentinels upon your 6 walls,
    Jerusalem,
    who never hold their peace by day or night.
    Remembrancers of the Eternal, never rest,
    never let the Eternal rest,	7
    till it is done, until he makes Jerusalem renowned on earth.
    The Eternal has sworn by his 8 right hand, by his strong arm,
    “Never again will I allow your foes
    to eat your corn, never again shall foreigners drink the wine
    that you have worked to grow; those who have harvested the 9 crop shall eat it, praising the Eternal, those who have gathered grapes shall quaff the wine within my sacred shrine.”
    Pass through the gates, pass out 10 to make a path for the returning exiles, bank up a causeway, clear out the stones; signal to the nations to . . .
    To the very ends of earth	11
    the Eternal has proclaimed this:
    “Tell the citizens of Sion, their deliverer is coming, bringing his reward with him, bringing his recompense;
        12 	their name shall be ‘The sacred People,’
    ‘The Redeemed of the Eter­nal.’ ”
    You shall he then a city much sought after— no forsaken city. s--i “Loud shall be my joy in10OA the Eternal, in my God will I rejoice; he has clothed me with victory, arrayed me in a robe of tri­umph;
    like a bridegroom he bestows a tiara,
    and gives me jewels like a bride.”
    * * *
    Who comes here, all crim­soned,
    his robes redder than the vintage?
    Who is it, arrayed in splendour, striding in his strength, radiant with victory, a mighty champion?
        2 	Why so red your robes,
    stained red like a vintager’s?
        3 	“All alone I trod the winepress,
    for no nation lent me aid; so I trod the foe in fury, trampled them down in my anger;
    ’twas their blood splashed my robes,
    till all my clothes are stained.
        4 	For I resolved upon a day of
    vengeance;
    the time to free my folk had
    come.
        5 	I looked, but there was none to
    help,
    I was amazed that there was none to aid;
    so my own power gained me the victory,
    it was my passion bore me on,
        6 	as I trampled the nations in my
    wrath
    and crashed them in my fury,
    spilling their blood upon the earth, and . .
    * * *
    I would tell over the Eternal’s 7 famous deeds, praising his acts of love, after all the Eternal has done for us,
    the Eternal so rich in care for us,
    after all his wealth of love and his compassion, when he said, “Surely they are 8 my own people, sons that will never play me false”;
    and so he proved himself their saviour
    in all their adversity.	9
    It was no envoy and no angel, ’twas his own Presence saved them;
    he rescued them himself in love and pity, he lifted them and carried them all through the days of old.
    But they, they thwarted him, 10 they pained his sacred Spirit; and so he turned to be their foe,
    he fought himself against them. Then they recalled the days of 11 old,
    the years gone by,
    “Ah, where is he,” they cried, “who at the sea granted a shepherd to his flock, inspiring him
    with his own sacred Spirit?
    Ah, where is he who with his 12 glorious power gave strength to Moses, who parted the waters in front of his folk,
    to win himself renown, who led them through the 13
    ocean-depths
    with never a stumble,
    like horses on a level plain,
        14 	like cattle moving to an open
    dale?
    He led his people safe like sheep, the Spirit of the Eternal guided them;
    so was it thou didst lead thy people,
    to win thyself renown and glory.”
        15 	Look down from heaven, look
    out
    from thy fair, sacred palace. Where is thy jealous care, thy prowess,
    thy yearning and thy pity?
        16 	Though Abraham may ignore us,
    though Israel regard us not, thou, O Eternal One, thou art our Father,
    our deliverer from of old.
        17 	Why leave us to wander from
    thy ways, O thou Eternal? Why harden our hearts till they are godless?
    Cease, for thy servants’ sake, for the sake of thine own clans.
        18 	Why should ungodly men scoff
    at thy sanctuary?
    Why should our foes profane thy shrine?
        19 	We fare like those who never
    knew thy rule,
    whom thou hast never claimed as thine.
    fZ/t Oh for the heavens to rend, 041? oh for thee to descend, till the very mountains shake before thee,
    2 like mere brushwood set ablaze, like water bubbling under fire—
    to let thy foes know what thou art,
    till the world trembles at thy presence,
    at thy dread actions, far be- 3 yond our dreams, far beyond all that men have 4 ever heard of!
    No ear has ever heard, no eye has ever seen, the mighty deeds that thou wilt do
    for those who look to thee.
    Oh for thy favour to those who 5 five aright,
    who call to mind thine orders! But thou hast been wroth at our sins,
    wroth at our breach of faith.
    We have become like men un- 6 clean,
    our goodness is a filthy rag, we fade like leaves, and our guilt sweeps us off; none calls to thee,	7
    none rouses himself to take hold of thee;
    for thou hast turned thy face from us,
    and left us to our guilt.
    Ah now, thou art our Father, O 8 Eternal,
    thine own hands have made us all;
    we are but clay, thou art the potter.
    O thou Eternal, be not furious 9 with us,
    remember not our guilt for ever;
    oh look down on us, we be­seech thee,
    for we are all thy people.
    Thy sacred towns are but a 10
    desert,
    Jerusalem is accursed; our sacred house of God, so 11 fair,
    in which our fathers sang thy praise,
    the flames have burned it to the ground,
    and all we loved lies ruined. Canst thou restrain thyself at 12 this, Eternal?
    Wilt thou be silent still and
    press us sore?

    “Ready was I to answer men who never asked
    me,
    ready to be found by men who never sought me.
    I cried out, ‘Here am I,’ to folk who never called to me.
        2 	I have stretched my hands, all
    day, to unruly rebels, who lead a life corrupt, pleas­ing themselves,
        3 	a people who provoke me to
    my face continually, by sacrificing in their groves, and burning incense under the white poplars—
        4 	people who sit on graves
    and pass the night in vaults, who eat the flesh of swine and cook them carrion broth,
        5 	who say, ‘Keep far away from
    me,
    lest I make you tabu’!
    Such men are like smoke from a blaze,
    that irritates me all the day.
        6 	’Tis all recorded before me,
    and I will not be silent till I punish
        7 	both their guilt and their
    fathers’,”
    the Eternal declares.
    “Men who burn incense on the heights,
    and insult me on hill-tops!— I will first weigh what they deserve,
    then let them have their pun­ishment.”
        8 	This is the Eternal’s word: “When a bunch of grapes holds
    some good wine,
    men say, ‘Destroy it not, it holds a blessing’; so for my servants’ sake I will not destroy the whole people.
    Jacob shall yield me some folk, 9 Judah shall yield me some heirs to my hills; those whom I choose shall own the land,
    and in it shall my servants dwell.
    For their flocks Sharon shall be 10 pasture,
    and cattle couch in Achor’s glen.
    But ye who have forsaken the 11 Eternal,
    ye who ignore his sacred hill, spreading tables to Good Luck, pouring libations to Fate,
    I make the sword your fate, 12 to slay and slaughter every one of you;
    for when I called you would not answer,
    you would not listen when I spoke,
    you did things evil in my sight, and chose what I abhorred.”
    This therefore is the Eternal’s 13 decree:
    “Behold, my servants shall have food,
    you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall have drink,
    you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall have
    joy.
    you shall have shame; behold, my servants shall exult 14 for joy of heart,
    but you shall cry for sorrow of heart,
    moaning in misery.
    My chosen ones shall use the 15 name you leave, in uttering a curse.
    Far other shall the name be
    that my servants bear!
        16 	He who prays for blessing in the
    land,
    now invokes the faithful God; he who takes an oath within the land
    now swears by the faithful God.
    For I ignore the troubles of the past,
    I shut mine eyes to them;
        17 	lo, I create new heavens
    and a new earth!
    The past shall be forgotten,
    and never come to mind;
        18 	men shall rejoice for ever
    in what I now create; Jerusalem I create to be a joy, her people a delight.
        19 	Over Jerusalem will I rejoice,
    I will exult in my people.
    No sound of tears, no voice of crying,
    shall ever be heard in her;
        20 	no babe shall die there any more
    in infancy,
    nor any old man who has not lived out his years of life; he who dies youngest lives a hundred years; anyone dying under a hundred years
    must be accursed by God.
        21 	They shall build houses and in­
    habit them,
    they shall plant vineyards and enjoy the fruit;
        22 	the homes they build, others
    shall not inhabit, what they plant, other men shall not enjoy.
    My people shall live long, as lives a tree,
    long shall my chosen folk en­joy their earnings;
        23 	they shall not work in vain,
    nor rear their children to die suddenly,
    for they are a race whom the Eternal blesses, and with them shall their children live.
    Ere ever they call to me, I an- 24
    swer,
    and while they speak I hear.
    Wolves and lambs shall browse 25 together,
    lions shall eat straw like oxen; none shall injure, none shall kill, says the Eternal, on my sa­cred hill.
    Heaven is my throne, says /T/T the Eternal,	OO
    my footstool is the earth.
    Where would you build a house for me,
    where would you rear me a home?
    Such buildings I have made my- 2 self already,
    they are my own, says the Eternal.
    What I care for are humble, broken creatures, who stand in awe of all I say.
    Oxen some sacrifice and also hu- 3 man lives,
    they offer lambs and also dogs in worship,
    oblations due and swine’s blood in their rites,
    incense, and yet they reverence an idol!
    Such are the practices they choose,
    delighting in abominable wor­ship;
    so I choose penalties for them, 4 and what they dread I bring on them.
    For when I called, none of them answered,
    none of them listened when I spoke;
    they did things evil in my sight, and chose what I abhorred.”
        2 	But ye who stand in awe of the
    Eternal’s word, listen to what he promises: “Your kinsmen, who hate you for your faith in me, sneer thus, ‘Let the Eternal show his might,
    that we may see this joy of yours!’
    They shall be taken aback!
        3 	Hark! the city is in uproar!
    It is coming from the temple! ’Tis the Eternal dealing venge­ance
    to the full upon his foes!
        4 	Ere ever Sion travailed,
    she gave birth; ere ever her pangs came, she bore a son!
        5 	Whoever heard of such a thing?
    whoever saw the like?
    Did ever land bring forth its people
    in a single day?
    Was ever any nation born thus all at once?
    Yet Sion had no sooner travailed, than she brought her sons to birth.
        6 	But why should I not help her
    to bring forth
    what I bring to the birth? says the Eternal.
    Why should I close the womb, when I
    have brought the babe to birth? so says your God.
        7 	Rejoice, Jerusalem; exult in her,
    all ye that love her; rejoice, rejoice with her, all ye who once mourned over her;
        8 	that you may suck and satisfy
    yourselves
    with her rich consolations, that you may drain, to your de­light,
    her ample mother-bosom.”
    For this is the Eternal’s word; i> “I send her in full flood pros­perity,
    the wealth of nations flowing into her;
    your children shall be carried in the arms,
    and dandled on the knees, and in Jerusalem I will comfort 13 you,
    as mothers comfort sons.”
    When you see this, your heart 14 shall be rejoicing, your health shall flourish like fresh grass,
    at sight of the Eternal’s favour to his servants,
    and of his wrath against his foes.
    For the Eternal comes like fire, 15 with chariots like a whirlwind, to deal his anger out in scorching heat,
    the blaze of his rebuke.
    On the whole world the Eternal 16 will pass sentence with his fire and sword.
    Any who consecrate and cleanse 17 themselves
    to enter groves for ritual dances,
    any who eat the flesh of swine, of mice and crawling vermin— their rites and their devices 18 shall perish, by the Eternal’s order.
    “The hour is near for summon­ing
    all nations and all races, to witness my display of might, a signal deed of dread.	19
    Those who survive my judg­ment I will send to far-off shores,
    to men who have not heard my name,
    nor ever seen my power.
    So shall my power be told among the nations,
        14 	and they shall bring your kins­
    men home,
    back to my sacred hill, back to Jerusalem,
    as their due offering to the Eternal,
    like offerings brought in vessels clean
    by Israelites to the Eternal’s temple.
        15 	Some of these kinsmen I will
    make
    Levitical priests, says the Eter­nal.
    For as the heavens and earth I 23 make anew
    shall last before me, the Eternal promises,
    so shall your name and race remain.”
    [[From new moon to new 23 moon and from sabbath to sab­bath, men shall all come to offer worship in my presence, says the Eternal; and then they shall go 24 outside to gloat over the corpses of the apostates, for in their corpses the worms never die, and the fire that burns them never is extinguished, till they are a dis­gust to all.]]
