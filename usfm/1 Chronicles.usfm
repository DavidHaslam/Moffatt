\v 10 But Jabez appealed to the God of Israel, \qt Oh that thou wouldest prosper me and enlarge my lot! Oh that thine hand might aid me! Oh that thou wouldest ward me from evil, that no hurt may befall me!\qt* And God granted him what he asked.]]

\p
\v 21 The sons of Shelah, Judah's son, were Er the founder of Lecah, Laadah the founder of Mareshah, and families of linen-workers at Beth-ashbea,
\v 22 Jokim, men of Kozeba, Joash, and Saraph who ruled in Moab and then retired to Bethlehem. This from an ancient archive.
\v 23 (These were the potters and inhabitants of Netaim and Gederah; they resided there in the service of the king.)
\p
\v 24 The sons of Simeon were Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul
\v 25 the father of Sliallum, whose son was Mibsam the father of Mishma;
\v 26 Mishma's son was Hammuel, the father of Zakkur, whose son was Shimei.
\v 27 Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers had not many children, nor did all their family multiply like the Judahites.
\v 28 They lived at Beersheba, Moladah, Hazarshual,
\v 29 Billiah, Ezem, Tolad,
\v 30 Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag,

\v 37 and Ziza (whose father was Shiphi the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah);
\v 38 these men here mentioned were chieftains, and their families prospered mightily.
\v 39 They went in search of pasture for their flocks to the entrance of Gerar, to the eastern side of the valley,
\v 40 where they found rich, excellent pasture, and a broad, quiet, peaceable countryside. (The inhabitants used to belong to the Hamites.)
\v 41 So during the reign of Hezekiah king of Judah the folk here mentioned went and destroyed the tents of the inhabitants, exterminating the Meunim who were to be found there, and taking their place, since there was pasture for their flocks there.
\v 42 Five hundred of these Simeonites also attacked mount Seir, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi;
\v 43 they defeated the
\pb surviving Amalekites who had escaped, and to this day they live there.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now for the sons of Reuben the eldest son of Israel. (He was the eldest, but, as he polluted his father's marriage-bed, his birthright was assigned to the sons of Joseph, Israel's son; although Joseph is not entered in the genealogy according to the birthright. The birthright did belong to Joseph,
\v 2 but Judah was more powerful than his brothers, and from him came the leadership.)
\v 3 The sons of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, were Hanok, Pallu, Hezron, and Karmi.
\v 4 The sons of Joel were Shemaiah, Gog, Shimri,
\v 5 Micah, Reaiah, Baal,
\v 6 and Beerah, whom the Assyrian king Tilgath-pilneser carried off into exile--Beerah was a Reubenite chieftain,
\v 7 and his kinsmen, reckoned by families in the genealogical records, were Jeiel the chief, then Zechariah,
\v 8 and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, whose settlements at Aroer reached the length of Nebo and Baalmeon,
\v 9 and stretched eastward as far as the opening of the desert ending at the river Euphrates--so numerous were their cattle in Gilead.
\v 10 (During the reign of Saul the Reubenites attacked the Hagrites and cut them to pieces, occupying all their territory east of Gilead.)
\p
\v 11 Opposite them lived the sons of Gad, occupying the land of Bashan as far as Salecah.
\v 12 Joel the chief, Shapham, Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan,
\v 13 with their seven fellow-clansmen Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jakan, Zia, and Eber,
\v 14 were sons of Abihail (the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jehishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz . . .
\v 15 Ahi, the son of Abdiel), all chiefs in their clan;
\v 16 they lived in Gilead, in Bashan, in the townships, and in all the pasture lands of Sirion to their fullest extent.
\v 17 These Gadites were all enrolled in the genealogical registers during the reign of Jotham king of Judah and during the reign of Jeroboam king of Israel.
\p
\v 18 The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-clan of Manasseh, brave fighters, able to carry shield and sword, good archers, and skilled warriors, amounted to forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty men, fit for active service.
\v 19 They attacked the Hagrites, and also Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
\v 20 God helped them and put the Hagrites and all their allies into their power; for they cried to God as they fought, and he answered them because they relied on him.
\v 21 They carried off the enemy's cattle, fifty thousand camels, two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, two thousand asses, and also a hundred thousand prisoners.
\v 22 Many of the enemy were also slain, for the war was with God's sanction. Down to the exile, they lived in the dispossessed territory.
\p
\v 23 The members of the half-clan of Manasseh who lived in the country swarmed from Bashan to Baal-hermon and Senir or mount Hermon.
\v 24 Their chiefs were Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, great fighters, famous men, and chiefs of the clan.
\v 25 But they broke faith with the God of their fathers and went faithlessly after the gods of the naives whom God had destroyed
\pb before them.
\v 26 So the God of Israel roused up Pulu the king of Assyria and Tilgath-pilneser the king of Assyria, who carried them into exile, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half­clan of Manasseh, taking them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan, where they are to this day.

\v 32 they carried on the service of song at the Trysting tent, till Solomon had built the temple of the Eternal at Jerusalem, fulfilling their office in due order.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 All Israel was registered in genealogies; the records lie in the Book of the Kings of Israel. Owing to their transgressions, the Jews were carried off into exile at Babylon.
\p
\v 2 The first to re-inhabit their settlements and towns were the laity of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the temple-attendants,
\v 3 though some Judahites, Benjamites, Ephraimites, and Manassites also resided at Jerusalem,
\v 4 namely, Uthai the son of Ammihud (the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani), belonging to the sons of Pharez the son of Judah,
\v 5 Asaiah the oldest member of the Shilonites, with his sons,
\v 6 Jeuel and his fellow-Zerahites, numbering six hundred and ninety,
\v 7-9 and nine hundred and fifty-six registered Benjamites, including Sallu the son of Meshullam (the son of Judah the son of Hasenuah), Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, Elah the son of Uzzi (the son of Michri), and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah (the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah); all these men were chiefs of their respective families.
\v 10 The priests were Jedaiah, Jehoiarib, Jachin,
\v 11 and Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the chief authority in the house of God,
\v 12 with Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer,
\v 13 besides their fellows, family chiefs, one thousand seven hundred and sixty most efficient men for the duties of service in the house of God.
\v 14 The Levites were Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, a Merarite,
\v 15 with Bakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, and Mattaniah son of Mica, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph,
\v 16 also Obadiah son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who resided in the villages of the Netophathites.
\v 17 The warders were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their kinsmen; Shallum was
\pb their head,
\v 18 stationed till now at the king's gate on the east. These were the warders of the sacred camp of the Levites.
\v 19 Shallum son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, with his fellow-Korahites of that family, were in charge of the service as keepers of the sacred thresholds, as their fathers had been keepers of the entrance in the sacred camp of the Eternal,
\v 20 when Phinehas the son of Eleazar ruled them (may the Eternal be with him!);
\v 21 Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah kept the door of the Trysting tent.
\v 22 All these, selected as warders at the entry, numbered two hundred and twelve. They were reckoned by their genealogies within their villages, appointed to their responsible duties by David and Samuel the seer;
\v 23 they and their sons had charge of the gates of the house of the Eternal (the Tent-house) as guards,
\v 24 acting as warders on the east, the west, the north, and the south sides of it.
\v 25 Their fellows in the villages had to come in periodically, every seven days, to join them,
\v 26 since four head warders, who were Levites, were constantly on duty, in charge of the chambers and the treasuries of the house of God,
\v 27 lodging in the vicinity of the house of God, as they bore the duty of watching it and were responsible for opening it every morning.
\v 28 Some of them had charge of the utensils of the service, which had to be counted when they were brought in and taken out.
\v 29 Others looked after the furniture and all the sacred utensils, as well as the flour, the wine, the oil, the incense, and the spices.
\v 30 Others, belonging to the priests, prepared the spices and cooked them.
\v 31 Mattithiah, a Levite, the eldest son of Shallum the Korahite, was responsible for the pastry of flat cakes,
\v 32 and some of the other Kohathites looked after the bread of the Presence, preparing it every sabbath.
\p
\v 33 [[These were the singers, family chiefs of the Levites, who lived in the temple-chambers, exempt from all other service, since they were on duty day and night.]]
\v 34 [[These were family chiefs of the Levites, reckoned by their genealogies, leading men, who lived at Jerusalem.]]
\p
\v 35 [[At Gibeon lived the founder of Gibeon, Jeiel, whose wife was called Maakah;
\v 36 his eldest son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
\v 37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth
\v 38 (the father of Shimeam). They also lived at Jerusalem, opposite their fellow-clansmen.
\v 39 Ner was the father of Kish, Kish of Saul, Saul of Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal;
\v 40 Jonathan's son was Merib-baal, the father of Micah,
\v 41 and Micah's sons were Pithon, Melek, and Tahrea.
\v 42 Ahaz was the father of Jarah, Jarah of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri, Zimri the father of Moza,
\v 43 whose son was Binea, the father of Rephaiah, the father of Eleasah, whose son was Azel;
\v 44 Azel had six sons, called Azrikam, Bokru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan; these were Azel's sons.]]
\c 10
\p
\v 1 When the Philistines made their attack on Israel, the men of Israel fled from the Philistines and dropped slain upon mount Gilboa.
\v 2 The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; they slew Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's
\pb sons.
\v 3 Saul himself was hard pressed in the fight, the archers got at him, and he was wounded by the archers.
\v 4 Then Saul said to his armour-bearer, \qt Draw your sword and run me through, lest these uncircumcised creatures come and make a fool of me.\qt* But his armour-bearer would not; he was terrified. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
\v 5 And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died.
\v 6 Thus Saul died, and his three sons; his whole household died together.
\v 7 (When all the men of Israel in the valley saw the flight and saw that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and took to flight; the Philistines then came and occupied them.)
\v 8 Next day, when the Philistines went to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons lying dead on mount Gilboa.
\v 9 They stripped him, cut his head off, took his armour, and sent messengers all round the Philistine country to carry the good news to their idols and people;
\v 10 his armour they placed in the temple of their gods, his head they nailed up in the temple of Dagon.
\v 11 But when all the men of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
\v 12 all the braves set out and removed the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons to Jabesh, burying their bones under the oak at Jabesh, and fasting for seven days.
\p
\v 13 Thus died Saul, for his faithlessness to the Eternal, because he had not kept the word of the Eternal, and also because he had consulted a medium, re­sorting to a medium and not to the Eternal;
\v 14 for this did the Eternal kill him, turning the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then all Israel gathered round David at Hebron, saying, \qt Here we are, your own bone and flesh!
\v 2 In bygone days, even when Saul was our king, it was you who led Israel out and in; the Eternal your God said to you, \+qt You shall shepherd my people Israel, you shall be prince over my people Israel!\+qt*\qt*
\v 3 So all the sheikhs of Israel came to the king at Hebron. David made a compact with them at Hebron, in presence of the Eternal, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the Eternal had ordered by Samuel.
\v 4 Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus),
\v 5 where the Jebusites, natives of the country, told David, \qt You will never get in here.\qt* But David did capture the stronghold of Sion (which is David’s burg).
\v 6 David proclaimed, \qt Whoever is the first to rout the Jebusites shall be commander-in-chief.\qt* Joab the son of Zerulah was the first to attack them, and he was made commander.
\v 7 David took up his residence in the strong­hold (hence it was called \qt David's burg\qt*),
\v 8 and built a wall round about the town, from the Millo rampart onwards, while Joab repaired the rest of the town.
\v 9 David became greater and greater, for the Lord of hosts was on his side.
\p
\v 10 These are the leading knights of David, who were his powerful supporters in the kingdom, uniting with all Israel to make him king, in terms of the Eternal's instructions for Israel.
\v 11 This is the number of David's knights. There was Ishbaal,
\pb the son of a Hachmonite, chief of the Trio, who once wielded his spear against three hundred men, whom he slew all at one time.
\v 12 Next him came Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the Trio of knights;
\v 13 he was with David at Pasdammim, in a field full of barley, where the Philistines had collected; the people had run away from the Philistines,
\v 14 but he held his ground in the field, kept the place, and slew the Philistines; the Eternal saved them by a great victory.
\v 19 Such were exploits of the Trio of knights.
\v 20 Abishai, the brother of Joab, was at the head of the Thirty, for he once wielded his spear against three hundred men whom he slew, and won a name like that of the Trio.
\v 21 He was the most distinguished of the Thirty and became their captain, but he was not promoted to a place in the Trio.
\v 22 Then there was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, from Kabzeel, a brave fighter, a man of doughty deeds; he killed two lion-cubs in their lair, after he had gone down and killed the lion inside a pit upon a snowy day.
\v 23 He also killed an Egyptian, a very tall man, seven and a half feet high, who carried a spear the size of a weaver's beam; Benaiah attacked him with a club, wrenched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.
\v 24 Such were the exploits of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada; he won a name like that of the Trio of knights,
\v 25 and was indeed renowned among the Thirty, but he was not pro­moted to the Trio. David put him at the head of his bodyguard.
\p
\v 15 Three of the Thirty once made their way down to the crag, to join David at the stronghold of Adullam. The Philistine force was camping in the valley of Rephaim;
\v 16 David was inside the stronghold, and there was a Philistine garrison at Bethlehem.
\v 17 David said longingly, \qt Oh if someone would only give me a drink of water from the well at Bethlehem, the well beside the gate!\qt*
\v 18 So the three broke through the Philistine lines, drew some water from the well at Bethlehem, the well beside the gate, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it; he poured it out for the Eternal,
\v 19 crying, \qt My God forbid that I should do it! Am I to drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives? For they have brought this water at the risk of their lives.\qt* So he would not drink it.
\v 26 Now for the heroes of the army: Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo (from Bethlehem),
\v 27 Shammoth from Harod, Helez the Pelonite,
\v 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh (from Tekoah), Abiezer from Anathoth,
\v 29 Sibbechai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,
\v 31 Ithai the son of Ribai from Gibeah (belonging to Benjamin), Benaiah the Pirathonite,
\v 32 Hiddai from the wadies of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
\v 33 Azmaveth from Bahurim, Efiahba from Shaalbon,
\v 34 the sons of Hashem from Gizon, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,
\v 35 Ahiam the son of Sakar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,
\v 36 Hepher from Mecherath, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
\v 37 Hezro from Karmel, Naarai the son of Ezbai,
\v 38 Joel the
\pb brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri,
\v 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armour-bearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,
\v 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
\v 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,
\v 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, Captain of a Reubenite company of thirty,
\v 43 Hanan the son of Maakah, Josaphat the Mithnite,
\v 44 Uzzia from Ashtaroth, Shama and Jehiel (their father was Hotham of Aroer),
\v 45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and his brother Joha (from Tizi),
\v 46 Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah (sons of Elnaam), Ithmah the Moabite,
\v 47 Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel from Zobah.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Here are the men who joined David at Ziklag, when, owing to Saul the son of Kish, he had no freedom of movement; they were among the strong men who helped him in the fray,
\v 2 they plied the bow, they could sling stones and shoot arrows with their right hand or their left, and they belonged to Saul's own clan of Benjamin.
\v 3 First came Ahiezer, then Joash son of Shemaiah from Gibeah, Jeziel and Pelet (sons of Azmaveth), Berachah, Jehu from Anathoth,
\v 4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite (a mighty member of the Thirty, whom he commanded), Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad from Gedor,
\v 5 Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,
\v 6 with Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashoboam, who were Korahites,
\v 7 Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
\p
\v 8 At the stronghold in the desert David was also joined by a number of Gadite warriors of prowess, soldiers trained for war,who could manage shield and spear, fierce-looking as lions and nimble as roes on the hill;
\v 9 there were Ezer, at their head, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
\v 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
\v 13 Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh.
\v 14 These were the Gadite captains, the weakest a match for any hundred men, the strongest a match for a thousand.
\v 15 It was these men who in the first month of the year forded the Jordan when it had overflowed all its banks, and routed the folk of the valleys east and west.
\p
\v 16 Some also came from Benjamin and Judah to join David at the stronghold;
\v 17 David went out to meet them, and told them, \qt If you come to me in peace to help me, then I am ready to join you; but if yOu come to betray me to my foes, though I have done no wrong, then may the God of our fathers take note of it and punish it!\qt*
\v 18 Amasa, who was commander-in-chief, was inspired to reply,
\q1 We are your men, David,
\q1 on your side, O son of Jesse!
\q1 Peace, peace to you,
\q1 and to your helpers peace--
\q1 for your God helps you!
\p Then David admitted them and made them captains of his band.
\v 19 Some also deserted to David from Manasseh; it was when he accompanied the Philistines to fight against Saul, but gave them no help, as the Philistine authorities after deliberating on the matter sent him away, believing that he would desert to Saul and cost them their lives.
\v 20 David then returned to Ziklag, where some Manassite commanders deserted to him,
\pb Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elibu, and Zillethai;
\v 21 they helped David against the raiders, for they were all warriors of prowess and took command of his host--
\v 22 a host that grew daily by its recruits, till it became a large host, a very host of God.
\p
\v 23 Here are the numbers of the armed divisions that joined David at Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, as the Eternal had declared.
\v 24 The Judahite warriors armed with shields and spears, were six thousand eight hundred;
\v 25 there were seven thousand one hun­dred Simeonites, warriors of prowess,
\v 26 four thousand six hundred Levites,
\v 27 and three thousand seven hundred Aaronites, led by Jehoiada,
\v 28 along with Zadok a young warrior of prowess, who had twenty-two captains of his father's family.
\v 29 There were three thousand from Benjamin, Saul's own clan, for till now the larger number of them had kept loyal to the house of Saul.
\v 30 There were twenty thousand eight hundred warriors of prowess from Ephraim, famous fighters in their families,
\v 31 and eighteen thousand (whose names were kept) from the half­clan of Manasseh, who came to make David king.
\v 32 There were two hundred leaders from Issachar, men who knew the needs of the time and what exactly Israel ought to do; they had all their clansmen at their command.
\v 33 There were fifty thousand men from Zebulun, fit for active service, taking the field with every weapon of war, a large company with a single purpose.
\v 34 From Naphtali came a thousand captains, with thirty-seven thousand men bearing shields and spears.
\v 35 There were twenty-eight thousand six hundred Danites, ready to take the field,
\v 36 and forty thousand from Asher, ready to take the field, fit for active service.
\v 37 From east of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half-clan of Manasseh, came a hundred and twenty thousand men, taking the field with every weapon of war.
\p
\v 38 All these trained soldiers, ready to take the field, came with one purpose to Hebron, to make David king over Israel; and the rest of Israel were all of the same mind, to make David king.
\v 39 They spent three days there with David, eating and drinking what their fellows had provided;
\v 40 and the neighbours, as far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, also brought food on asses, camels, mules, and oxen, flour-cakes, fig-cakes, bunches of raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and plenty of sheep; for joy reigned in Israel.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Then David consulted the commanders and generals, indeed all the leaders;
\v 2 David said to the war-council of Israel, \qt If you agree, and if it is the mind of the Eternal our God, let us send quickly to the rest of our fellows in the land of Israel (since the priests and Levites are with them in their towns that have open lands), that they may join us
\v 3 in bringing back the ark of God; for during the reign of Saul we never inquired about it.\qt*
\v 4 The war-council all said that they would, for the proposal seemed right to all the people.
\p
\v 5 So David mustered all Israel from the Wady-el-Arish to the pass of Hamath, in order to
\pb convey the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim;
\v 6 David and all Israel went up to Baalah or Kiriath-jearim (it belongs to Judah) in order to convey the ark of God, belonging to the Eternal who sits enthroned upon the kherubs;
\v 7 and they carried the ark of God from the house of Abinadab on a new cart. Uzza and Ahio drove the cart,
\v 8 while David and all Israel danced before God with all their might, singing and playing on lyres and lutes and drums and cymbals and bugles.
\v 9 But when they reached the threshing-floor of Kidon, Uzza put out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen were slipping;
\v 10 then the anger of the Eternal blazed out against Uzza, the Eternal struck him down because he had put out his hand to the ark, and he died on the spot before God.
\v 11 David was angry because the Eternal had broken out upon Uzza, and he called the spot Perez-uzza or \qt Breaking of Uzza\qt*--as it still is called to this day.
\v 12 David was afraid of God that day; he said, \qt How can I take God's ark home?\qt*
\v 13 So David did not place the ark in his (David's) burg, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite;
\v 14 for three months the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom, at his house, and the Eternal blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that he had.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 When Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, with cedar-logs, masons, and carpenters, to build him a palace,
\v 2 David realized that the Eternal had set him to be king over Israel, for the sake of his people Israel, since David's kingdom was highly exalted.
\v 3 At Jerusalem David took more wives, and more sons and daughters were born to him.
\v 4 The following are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
\v 5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
\v 6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
\v 7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Ehphelet.
\p
\v 8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines marched up in search of David. But David heard of it and sallied out to meet them.
\v 9 Meantime the Philistines had made a foray through the valley of Rephaim.
\v 10 So David asked God, \qt Shall I attack the Philistines? And wilt thou put them into my hands?\qt* The Eternal said to him, \qt Attack them, for I will put them into your hands.\qt*
\v 11 Up came the Philistines as far as Baal-perazim, where David routed them. \qt God has broken my foes by my power,\qt* said David, \qt like water bursting a dam!\qt* So the spot was called Baal-perazim (or \qt lord of bursts\qt*).
\v 12 The Philistines left their gods behind them there, and by David's order they were burned up.
\v 13 Back came the Philistines on a foray through the valley.
\v 14 David again asked God, and God said to him, \qt You must not march after them; sweep aside and attack them in front of the balsam-trees.
\v 15 Whenever you hear a sound of movement among the tops of the balsam-trees, then launch your attack, for God will have gone in front of you to rout the Philistine army.\qt*
\v 16 David did as God ordered him, and routed the Philistine army from Gibeon all the way to Gezer.
\v 17 So the fame of David spread to all countries, and the
\pb Eternal put the fear of him on all nations.
\c 15
\p
\v1 He not only built himself houses in David's burg but prepared a site for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
\v 2 Then David ordered that no one should carry the ark of God except the Levites, since the Eternal had chosen them to carry the ark of God and to
\v 3 serve him always. So, when David convened all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the Eternal up to the place which he had prepared for it,
\v 4 David mustered the Aaronites and the Levites.
\v 5 At the head of the Kohathites was Uriel, with a hundred and twenty of his fellows;
\v 6 at the head of the Merarites was Asaiah, with two hundred and twenty of his fellows;
\v 7 at the head of the Gershomites was Joel, with a hundred and thirty of his fellows;
\v 8 at the head of the sons of Elizaphan was Shemaiah, with two hundred of his fellows;
\v 9 at the head of the sons of Hebron was Eliel, with eighty of his fellows;
\v 10 and at the head of the sons of Uzziel was Amminadab, with a hundred and twelve of his fellows.
\p
\v 11 Summoning Zadok and Abiathar the priests along with Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab the Levites,
\v 12 David said to them, \qt You are the heads of the Levitical families; purify yourselves, you and your fellows, for bringing the ark of the Eternal, the God of Israel, up to the site I have prepared for it.
\v 13 It was because you did not carry it at first, that the Eternal our God broke out upon us, because we did not go about it in the proper way.\qt*
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites purified themselves for bringing up the ark of the Eternal the God of Israel,
\v 15 and the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with poles, as the Eternal had bidden Moses give orders.
\p
\v 16 David also bade the heads of the Levites appoint some of their fellows to the service of song, with musical instruments, lutes, lyres, and cymbals, to beat time and to shout with joy.
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, his fellow-Levite Asaph the son of Berechiah, and, from their fellows the Merarites, Ethan the son of Kushaiah,
\v 18 together with twelve others, Zechariah, Bani, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphlehu, and Mikneiah, also the warders Obededom and Jeiel.
\v 19 Of the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan had to beat time with bronze cymbals;
\v 20 Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah had to lead the praise with lutes set for soprano voices,
\v 21 while Mattithiah, Eliphlehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jehiel, and Azarlah had to use harps set for bass voices.
\v 22 Chenaniah the Levitical leader was in charge of the transport; he gave directions about the transport, as he was an expert.
\v 23 Berechiah and Elkanah acted as warders for the ark,
\v 24 while the priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer sounded the bugles in front of the ark of God.
\p
\v 25 So went David and the sheikhs of Israel and the generals joyfully to bring up the ark of the compact of the Eternal
\pb from the house of Obed-edom;
\v 26 and after God had helped the Levites who carried the ark of the compact of the Eternal, they sacrificed seven, bullocks and seven rams.
\v 27 David and all the Levites who carried the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the head of the transport, danced with all their might, David wearing a linen kilt.
\v 28 Thus did all Israel bring up the ark of the compact of the Eter­nal with shouts, with blasts of bugles and trumpets and cym­bals, beating time with lutes and lyres.
\v 29 (As the ark of the com­pact of the Eternal reached David's burg, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window; and when she saw king David whirling about and sporting, she despised him in her heart.)
\c 16
\v 1 After bringing in the ark of the compact of the Eternal, they put it in its place, inside the tent pitched for it by David; they sacrificed burnt-offerings and recompense-offerings before God,
\v 2 and when David had finished sacrificing the burnt-offerings and recompense-offerings before God, he blessed the people in the name of the Eternal,
\v 3 and distributed to every man and woman in Israel a loaf of bread, a slice of meat, and a bunch of raisins apiece.
\v 4 He appointed certain Levites to serve before the ark of the Eternal, to commemorate and thank and praise the Eternal the God of Israel;
\v 5 of these the leader was Asaph, and next to him Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with lutes and lyres, Asaph always beating time with cymbals,
\v 6 Benaiah and Jaaziel the priests with bugles, before the ark of the compact of God.
\v 7 On that day David first commissioned Asaph and his fellows to offer thanks to the Eternal, thus:
\v 8
\q1 Give thanks to the Eternal, proclaim his fame,
\q2 celebrate among the nations his exploits;
\v 9
\q1 sing to him, make music to him,
\q2 go over all the wonders he has done;
\v 10
\q1 glory in his sacred name,
\q2 let worshippers of the Eternal rejoice in heart.
\v 11
\q1 Worship the Eternal and be n strengthened,
\q2 worship in his presence evermore,
\v 12
\q1 remember the wonders he has done,
\q2 his marvels and his sentences of doom,
\v 13
\q1 0 race of Israel his servant,
\q2 0 sons of Jacob whom he chose.
\p
\v 14
\q1 The Eternal, he is our God,
\q2 and his authority is over all the earth.
\v 15
\q1 Never forget his compact,
\q2 the pledge he gave for a thousand generations,
\v 16
\q1 the compact made with Abraham,
\q2 the oath he swore to Isaac,
\v 17
\q1 confirming it as a decree to Jacob,
\q2 for Israel as a lasting compact,
\v 18
\q1 that he would give them Canaan's land,
\q2 to hold it as their own possession.
\p
\v 19
\q1 Few in number were our fathers,
\q2 few and foreigners,
\v 20
\q1 wandering from one nation to another,
\q2 and from realm to realm;
\v 21
\q1 but he would not let a man oppress them,
\q2 he would punish kings on their account,
\v 22
\q1 saying, \qt Never touch my chosen,
\q2 my prophets never harm.\qt*
\p
\v 23
\q1 Sing, all the earth, to the Eternal,
\q2 day after day tell of his saving aid;
\v 24
\q1 let the heathen hear his glory,
\pb
\q2 let every nation know the wonders he has done.
\v 25
\q1 For great is the Eternal, loudly to be praised,
\q2 and to be feared above all gods;
\v 26
\q1 for all gods of the nations are mere idols,
\q2 but the Eternal made the heavens;
\v 27
\q1 grandeur and majesty attend him,
\q2 splendour and joy are in his temple.
\v 28
\p
\q1Praise the Eternal, O families of the nations,
\q2 praise the Eternal for his glory and his might!
\v 29
\q1 Praise the Eternal for his own open glory,
\q2 enter his presence with an offering,
\q1 kneel before God in sacred vestments;
\v 30
\q2 tremble before him, all the earth;
\q2 he has steadied and settled the world.
\p
\v 31
\q1 Let the skies be glad, let earth rejoice,
\q2 proclaim to pagans that the Eternal is king.
\v 32
\q1 Let the sea and all within it thunder praise,
\q2 let the fields and all they hold exult,
\v 33
\q1 let the trees of the forest sing for joy
\q2 at the Eternal's presence
\q3 --for he comes to rule the earth.
\p
\v 34
\q1 Give thanks to the Eternal!--he is good;
\q2 his kindness never fails.
\v 35
\q1 And cry, "O God of our salvation, save us,
\q2 gather us, free us, from the heathen,
\q1 to give thanks to thy sacred name,
\q2 to triumph in thy deeds of praise."
\v 36
\q1 Blessed be the Eternal, Israel's God,
\q2 from age to age, for ever!
\p
And all the people added "Amen," praising the Eternal.
\v 37 David then left Asaph and his fellows there at the service of the ark for all time, as each day's duty required,
\v 38 with Obed-edom, Hosa, and their sixty-eight comrades to guard the gates,
\v 39 and Zadok with his fellow-priests to offer the burnt-sacrifice to the Eternal, before the tent of the Eternal on the height at Gibeon,
\v 40 upon the altar of burnt-offerings every morning and every evening, in accordance with all the injunctions laid down by the Eternal in his law for Israel;
\v 41 Heman, Jeduthun, and the others already mentioned by name, chosen for this service, were left to give thanks to the Eternal, "whose kindness never fails,"
\v 42 possessing bugles and cymbals for the use of musicians, and other instruments used in sacred song (the sons of Jeduthun acting as warders).
\v 43 Then the people all went home, and David went home to greet his family.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 After David had taken up residence in his palace, he said to the prophet Nathan, "Here am I staying in a house of cedar, while the ark of the compact of the Eternal is under the curtains of a tent!"
\v 2 Nathan said to David, "Do whatever is in your mind, for God is with you."
\v 3 But that very night God's word came to Nathan:
\v 4 "Go and give my servant David this message from the Eternal: ‘You are not to build me a temple to stay in,
\v 5 for I have never stayed in a temple, from the day that I brought out the Israelites down to this day; I have always gone from tent to tent, with that as my Dwelling.
\v 6 Wherever moved with all Israel, did I ever
\pb ask a single one of Israel's leaders, whom I ordered to rule my people, why they had not built me a house of cedar?'
\v 7 No, give my servant David this message from the Lord of hosts: 'I took you from the pasture land, from tending sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel;
\v 8 I have been with you wherever you went, to cut off all your enemies before you; and I will make you renowned like the great men upon earth;
\v 9 I will fix a place for my people Israel and plant them firm in their place till they are never unsettled again--violent men shall no longer harry them as they have done in bygone days,
\v 10 ever since I had to raise up champions for my people Israel; I will subdue all your enemies.' Also the Eternal tells you that he will build up a family for you;
\v 11 when all your days are done and you must go to join your fathers, 'I will raise your offspring, one of your own sons, and establish his dynasty.
\v 12 (He shall build a temple for me, and I will establish his throne for all time.)
\v 13
\q1 To him will I be a father, to me he shall be a son,
\q1 nor will I take back my kindness from him,
\q2 as I took it from him who was before you;
\v 14
\q1 I will fix him in my house and kingdom for all time,
\q1 for all time shall his throne be established.'"
\p
\v 15 Thus did Nathan speak to David, in terms of all these words and of all this vision.
\p
\v 16 Then king David went in and sat down before the Eternal, saying, "Who am God the Eternal, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?
\v 17 And thou hast reckoned this a small favour, 0 God! Thou hast actually spoken of thy servant's house for ages to come, and . . .
\v 18 What more need David say to thee of this honour to thy humble servant?
\v 19 Thou knowest thy servant, 0 Eternal; it is for thy servant's sake and out of thine own heart that thou hast acted in revealing all this great future.
\v 20 0 Eternal, there is none like thee, no god except thee, that we have ever heard of!
\v 21 And who is like thy people Israel, a unique nation upon earth, whom God went to redeem to be a people for himself, to win thyself a name by great and terrible exploits, driving out nations before thy people whom thou didst redeem from Egypt?
\v 22 For thou hast made thy people Israel to be thine own people for ever; and thou, O Eternal, hast become their God.
\v 23 Now, O Eternal, let thy promise to thy servant and his house be fixed for ever, and do as thou hast said,
\v 24 that thy renown may be fixed and great for ever, when men say, 'The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, are a God to Israel,' and when thy servant David's house is fixed and firm before thee.
\v 25 For, O my God, thy servant has 23 ventured to pray thus to thee, because thou hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him up a family.
\v 26 O Eternal, thou art God, thou hast made this kind promise to thy servant;
\v 27 thou hast been pleased to bless the family of thy servant, that it may continue in thy presence always; thou hast blessed it, O Eternal, and blessed it is for ever!"
\c 18
\v 1 After this David defeated the Philistines and subdued them; he took Gath and its townships from the Philistines.
\pb
\v 2 He defeated Moab, till the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute.
\v 3 Then David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah at Helam, as he went to set up his trophy of victory on the Euphrates;
\v 4 from him David captured a thousand chariots, seven thousand cavalry, and twenty thousand infantry; David hamstrung all the chariot horses, except enough for a hundred chariots.
\v 5 When the Aramaeans of Damascus came to the aid of Hadad-ezer, king of Zobah, David killed twenty-two thousand Arameans,
\v 6 and then posted garrisons among the Aramaeans of Damascus; this made the Aramaeans subject to David, and they brought him tribute. In­deed, wherever David went, the Eternal gave him victory.
\v 7 David took the golden shields worn by Hadadezer's officers and brought them to Jerusalem;
\v 8 and from Tibhath and Kun, towns belonging to Hadadezer, David took a very large quan­tity of bronze, which Solomon used to make the tank, the columns, and the articles of bronze.
\p
\v 9 When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the forces of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
\v 10 he sent his son Hadoram to salute king David and congratulate him on fighting and defeating Hadadezer, for Hadad­ezer had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought with him all sorts of gold, silver, and bronze ware,
\v 11 which king David dedicated to the Eternal along with the silver and gold which he had carried off from all nations, from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.
\p
\v 12 On his way back, David killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the wady of Salt,
\v 13 and posted garrisons throughout Edom, till all the Edomites became subject to David. Wherever David went, the Eternal gave him victory.
\v 14 David reigned over all Israel; he himself administered justice and the law to all his people.
\v 15 Joab the son of Zerrnah was in command of the army, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chancellor,
\v 16 Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelek the son of Abiathar were his priests,
\v 17 Shavsha was secretary, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the foreign bodyguard, and David's sons were his majesty's lieutenants.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 It was after this that Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned instead of him.
\v 2 David thought, "I will be kind to Hanun the son of Nahash, since his father was kind to me." So David sent envoys to condole with him over his father's death. But when David's officers reached the land of the Ammonites, on their way to condole with Hanun,
\v 3 the Ammonite princes said to Hanun, "Do you imagine David is paying respect to your father in sending you this message of sympathy? Have not his officers come to explore, to overthrow the country by spying it out?"
\v 4 Then Hanun seized David's officers, shaved them, cut their robes in two, as far as their waists, and sent them off.
\v 5 News was brought to David of the plight of his men. He sent to meet them--for they were terribly ashamed; "Stay at Jericho," said the king, "till your beards grow, and then come home."
\pb
\p
\v 6 When the Ammonites found they had brought themselves into bad odour with David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent four hundred and twelve thousand five hundred pounds in silver to hire chariots and cavalry from Mesopotamia, Arammaacah, and Zobah;
\v 7 they hired thirty-two thousand chariots, as well as the king of Maakah with his men, who came and camped in front of Medeba. Meantime the Ammonites mustered from their towns for battle.
\v 8 On hearing this, David despatched Joab and all the army with the veterans.
\v 9 The Ammonites marched out and formed up at the entrance to the town, while the allied kings posted themselves apart in the open country.
\v 10 Joab, seeing that he was threatened both in front and in the rear, selected all the picked men of Israel and arrayed them against the Aramaeans;
\v 11 the rest of the troops he put in charge of his brother Abishai, and they deployed against the Ammonites.
\v 12 "If the Aramaeans prove too strong for me," he said, "you must help me; but if the Ammonites prove too strong for you, then I will come to your aid!
\v 13 Courage! Let us play the man for our people and for the towns of our God! And may the Eternal do what he deems right!"
\p
\v 14 So Joab and his force moved forward to face the Aramaeans in fight; they fled before him.
\v 15 Whereupon the Ammonites, seeing that the Aramaeans had fled, fled themselves before his brother Abishai and got inside the town. So Joab marched back to Jerusalem.
\v 16 But when the Aramaeans saw they had been defeated by Israel, they despatched messengers and brought out the Aramaeans from across the Euphrates, headed by Shophach the general of Hadadezer’s army.
\v 17 When David was told of this, he mustered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam, where he drew up in battle array against them.
\v 18 There the Aramaeans fought, and fled before Israel; David destroyed seven thousand Aramaean chariots and forty thousand of their infantry, and killed Shophach the general of their army.
\v 19 When the folk of Hadadezer saw they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him; nor would the Aramaeans help the Ammonites any more.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Next spring, at the time of year when kings start on their campaigns, Joab led out the main force and ravaged the land of the Ammonites; he went and besieged Rabbah, while David remained at Jerusalem. Joab stormed Rabbah and sacked it.
\v 2 When David took the golden crown from the head of their idol Milkom, he found that it weighed about a hundred pounds; it contained a jewel, which was placed on David's head. He also brought away the spoil of the town, a vast amount,
\v 3 and the townsfolk, whom he set to work with saws and iron picks and axes. He did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and all the troops returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 4 After this a fight started with the Philistines at Gezer, where Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Sippai a descendant of the giant-race, and so the Philistines were subdued.
\v 5 There was another fight with the Philistines, when
\pb Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lakmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear had a shaft like a weaver’s beam.
\v 6 There was another fight at Gath, where a huge man, with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, another descendant of the giant-race,
\v 7 defied Israel, but David's nephew Jonathan, the son of Shimea, killed him.
\v 8 These were descendants of the giant-race in Gath, and they fell by the hand of David and his officers.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Satan now made a move against Israel; he incited David to number Israel.
\v 2 So David told Joab and the commanders of the nation to go and number Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and bring him word, that he might know the total.
\v 3 Joab said to the king, "May the Eternal make his people a hundred times as large as it is to-day! But is not my lord their king? Are they not all my lord's servants? Why should my lord the king insist on this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?"
\v 4 Nevertheless the king's orders over­bore Joab. So Joab retired; he went all over Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.
\v 5 Joab reported to David the total number of the people who had been registered; all in Israel amounted to one million one hundred thousand men-at-arms, while Judah numbered four hundred and seventy thousand men-at-arms.
\v 6 (Joab had not counted Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king's order was detestable to him.)
\p
\v 7 Now God was displeased at this action; so he struck Israel.
\v 8 Then said David to God, "I have sinned greatly in doing this; pray take away the sin ofthy servant, for I have done a senseless deed!"
\v 9 The Eternal said to Gad, David's seer,
\v 10 "Go and tell David that this is what the Eternal says: 'I put three things before you; choose one of them to befall you.'"
\v 11 So Gad went and told David that the Eternal said, "Take what you please:
\v 12 three years of famine, three months of defeat at the hand of your foes, while they chase you and cut you down, or three days of the Eternal's own sword, pestilence in the land and the angel of the Eternal dealing death all over Israel. Consider," said Gad, "what answer I am to take to him who sent me."
\v 13 "I am in a terrible difficulty," said David to Gad; "however, let me fall into the hands of the Eternal (for his mercies are many), not into the hands of men."
\p
\v 14 So the Eternal sent a pestilence upon Israel, and Israel lost seventy thousand men.
\v 15 God even sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem; but, as he was on the point of destroying it, the Eternal looked and changed his mind about the punishment; he said to the destroying angel, "Enough! hold your hand!" The angel of the Eternal was standing beside the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite,
\v 16 and when David raised his eyes, he saw the angel of the Eternal in mid-air, holding a drawn sword over Jerusalem. Then David and the sheikhs, clothed in sackcloth, dropped on their faces,
\v 17 and David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the people to be numbered? It was I who sinned, I who acted so wickedly! But these poor creatures, what have they done? Let thine hand, O Eternal my God, be against me and against
\pb my fathers house, not against my people, to plague them."
\v 18 Then the angel of the Eternal ordered Gad to tell David to go up and erect an altar to the Eternal at the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite.
\v 19 At the bidding of Gad, who spoke in the name of the Eternal, David did go up.
\v 20 When Oman turned round, he saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Oman was threshing wheat;
\v 21 and, as David approached him, Oman looked out, and when he saw David he went outside the threshing-floor and bowed to the king with his face to the ground.
\v 22 Then said David to Oman, "Let me have the site of this threshing-floor in order to build an altar to the Eternal, that the plague may be averted from the people. You must take the full price for it."
\v 23 "Take it as your own," said Oman; "let my lord the king do whatever he pleases. Here I give you the oxen for burnt-offerings; and the threshing-sledges for wood, and the wheat for the cereal-offering: I give you them all."
\v 24 "No, indeed," said king David to Oman; "I will buy it for its full price; I will not take what belongs to you for the Eternal, nor offer a burnt-offering that has cost me nothing.”
\v 25 So David gave Ornan a thousand golden guineas for the site;
\v 26 and there David built an altar for the Eternal, and offered burnt-offerings and recompense-offerings, worshipping the Eternal, who answered him from heaven with fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
\v 27 Then at the bidding of the Eternal, the angel sheathed his sword again.
\p
\v 28 Then it was, as David saw that the Eternal had answered his sacrifice at the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite
\v 29 (for although the tent of the Eternal, made by Moses in the desert, and the altar of burnt-offering were then on the height at Gibeon,
\v 30 David could not approach them to consult God there, he was so terrified of the sword of the angel of the Eternal),
\c 22
\v 1 that David declared, "This is to be the house of God the Eternal, this is to be the altar of burnt-offering for Israel!"
\v 2 So David had all the aliens in the land of Israel collected, and he set masons to hew cut stones for building the house of God;
\v 3 David prepared plenty of iron to make nails for the doors of the gates, and clamps; also plenty of bronze, without weighing it,
\v 4 and innumerable cedar-trees--for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought plenty of cedar-trees to David.
\v 5 David reflected, "As Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and as the house which is to be built for the Eternal must be incomparably magnificent, far-famed, and glorious throughout all lands, I must make preparations for it." So David made ample preparations before he died.
\p
\v 6 Then he summoned Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the Eternal the God of Israel,
\v 7 saying to Solomon, "My son, I myself intended to build a temple for the Eternal my God.
\v 8 But the word of the Eternal came to me, 'You have shed much blood, you have waged great wars; you shall not build me a temple, because you have shed so much blood on earth under my eyes.
\v 9 No, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of peace; I will grant him solace from all his enemies
\pb round about, for his name shall be "Solomon," and during his reign I will grant Israel solace and quiet;
\v 10 he shall build me a temple; he shall be a son to me and I will be a father to him and establish his royal throne over Israel for all time.'
\v 11 Now, my son, may the Eternal be with you, that you may succeed in building the temple of the Eternal your God, as he has directed you!
\v 12 Only may the Eternal grant you discretion and insight, as you are put in charge of Israel, so that you may obey the law of the Eternal your God.
\v 13 If you are mindful to carry out the rules and regulations laid down for Israel by Moses at the bidding of the Eternal, you will succeed. Be firm and brave; never be daunted or dismayed.
\v 14 Here have I prepared, with great pains, nine million six hundred thousand pounds' weight of gold, ninety-six million pounds' weight of silver, and bronze and iron past all weighing for their amount; timber and stones I have also supplied, and you may add to them.
\v 15 Besides, you have plenty of workmen, masons, carpenters, and all manner of skilled tradesmen.
\v 16 There is no end of gold, silver, bronze, and iron. Set to work,and may the Eternal be with you!"
\p
\v 17 David also ordered all the authorities of Israel to help Solomon his son.
\v 18 "Is not the Eternal your God with you?" he asked. "Has he not granted you peace on every side? He has put the nations into my power, till the country lies subdued before the Eternal and his people.
\v 19 Make up your minds to revere the Eternal your God; set about building the sanctuary of God the Eternal, that you may bring the ark of the compact of the Eternal and the sacred vessels of God into the temple that is to be built for the Eternal."
\c 23
\p
\v 1 When David grew old, after a full life, he made Solomon his son king over Israel,
\v 2 and summoned all the authorities of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
\v 3 The Levites were registered from thirty years and upwards, and the total number of their males was thirty-eight thousand,
\v 4 twenty-four thousand having to superintend the work of building the temple of the Eternal, six thousand acting as sheriffs and judges,
\v 5 four thousand as warders, and four thousand praising the Eternal on "the musical instruments which I have made," said David, "for the service of praise."
\v 6 David arranged them in divisions, after Gershom, Kohath, and Merari, the sons of Levi.
\p
\v 7 The Gershomites were Ladan and Shimei;
\v 8 Ladan's three sons were Jehiel, the eldest, Zetham, and Joel,
\v 9 while Shimei's three sons were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran;
\v 10 Shelomoth had four sons, Jahath, Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah;
\v 11 Jahath was the eldest, Ziza the second son, but as Jeush and Beriah had not many sons they were counted together as a single family.
\v 12 The Kohathites were four in number, Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
\v 13 Amram's sons were Aaron and Moses; Aaron was set apart for a specially sacred consecration, that he and his sons should for all time burn incense before the Eternal, serving him, and in his name pronouncing the blessing for all time.
\v 14 As for Moses the man of God, his sons were reckoned among the clan of
\pb Levi.
\v 15 The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer;
\v 16 Gershom's eldest son was Shubael,
\v 17 and Eliezer's son was Rehabiah (a headman); Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had a large number.
\v 18 Izhar's son was Shelomoth (a headman);
\v 19 Hebron's sons were Jeriah, the eldest, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth;
\v 20 Uzziel's sons were Micah the eldest and Isshiah the second.
\p
\v 21 The Merarites were Mahli and Mushi; Mahli's sons were Eleazar and Kish;
\v 22 Eleazar died, leaving no sons, only daughters, who were married to their cousins the sons of Kish.
\v 23 Mushi's three sons were Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.
\p
\v 24 Such were the Levites by families, the headmen among those who were registered individually, who worked in the service of the temple of the Eternal, from twenty years and upwards.
\v 25 (For David said, "The Eternal the God of Israel has granted peace to his people, and he now dwells in Jerusalem for all time;
\v 26 the Levites no longer require to carry the tent or any of the articles needed for its service.")
\v 27 For by the last orders of David the Levites were registered from twenty years and upwards.
\v 28 Their duty was to attend the sons of Aaron in the service of the temple of the Eternal, looking after the courts and the chambers and the cleansing of all that was sacred, also, in the service of the temple of God,
\v 29 caring for the bread of the Presence, the flour for cereal-offerings, either unleavened wafers or cakes baked on the griddle or pastry, and looking after all the weights and measures,
\v 30 standing every morning and evening to thank and praise the Eternal, and presiding before the Eternal for all time
\v 31 at every burnt-offering to the Eternal, as prescribed in due number on the sabbaths, at the new moon, and on the standing festivals;
\v 32 they had charge of the Trysting tent, of the sacred ritual, and of all that their fellows the sons of Aaron required to have done in the service of the temple of the Eternal.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 As for the divisions of the sons of Aaron—the sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
\v 2 Nadab and Abihu died before their father, leaving no children; so Eleazar and Ithamar discharged the priestly office.
\v 3 David, assisted by Zadok, a son of Eleazar, and Abimelek, a son of Ithamar, divided the Aaronites by the following arrangement.
\v 4 As it was found that there were more headmen belonging to the sons of Eleazar than to the sons of Ithamar, the sons of Eleazar were assigned sixteen divisions, and the sons of Ithamar eight;
\v 5 they were classified equally by lot, for authorities of the sanctuary and authorities of God were drawn from both the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar;
\v 6 Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe (he was a Levite) wrote down their names in presence of the king, the authorities, Zadok the priest, Abimelek the son of Abiathar, and the headmen of the families of priests and Levites, a family being drawn alternately for the sons of Eleazar and for the sons of Ithamar.
\v 7 The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
\v 8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
\v 9 the fifth to
\pb Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
\v 10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
\v 11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
\v 12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
\v 13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
\v 14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
\v 15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
\v 16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel.
\v 17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
\v 18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
\v 19 Such was their order for coining on duty in the temple of the Eternal, to serve as prescribed by their ancestor Aaron, in terms of what the Eternal the God of Israel had commanded him.
\p
\v 20 The rest of the Levites were: Shubael a son of Amram, Jehdeiah a son of Shubael,
\v 21 Isshiah (the headman) a son of Rehabiah,
\v 22 Shelomoth an Izharite, and Jahath a son of Shelomoth;
\v 23 Jeriah the eldest, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth, sons of Hebron;
\v 24 Micah a son of Uzziel, Shamir a son of Micah,
\v 25 Isshiah the brother of Micah, and Zechariah a son of Isshiah;
\v 26 Mahli and Mushi and the family of Uzziah, Merarites, the family of Uzziah being Bani,
\v 27 Shoham, Zakkur, and Ibri,
\v 28 Mahli's sons being Eleazar (who left no sons)
\v 29 and Kish (the father of Jerahmeel),
\v 30 and Mushi's sons being Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the Levites by their families.
\v 31 They too, like their fellows the Aaronites, cast lots in presence of David the king, Zadok, Abimelek, and the headmen of the priests of the Levites, the eldest and head of the house casting lots like his younger brother.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 David and the authorities of the temple service also set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, to prophesy on lyres, lutes, and cymbals. The number of those who performed this duty in the musical service was as follows.
\p
\v 2 Of the Asaphites, Zakkur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah, as directed by Asaph, who prophesied at the bidding of the king;
\v 3 of the sons of Jeduthun, Gedaliah, Izri, Jeshaiah, Hashablah, Shimei, and Mattithiah, these six as directed by their father Jeduthun, who prophesied on the lyre, thanking and praising the Eternal thus:
\q1 Be gracious to me, Lord, be gracious to me,
\q1 thou art my God whom I exalt and extol;
\q1 thou art my help in hardship,
\q1 Oh grant me many a vision of thyself!
\v 4 Of the Hemanites, Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shubael, and Jerimoth,
\v 5 all sons of Heman the king's seer in matters spiritual (God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters).
\v 6 All these were under the directions of their fathers for the service of praise in the temple of the Eternal, playing cymbals, lutes, and lyres in the service of God's temple, while Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman themselves were at the bidding of the king.
\p
\v 7 Their total number, including all their fellows who were specially trained singers for the Eternal, amounted to two hundred and eighty-eight.
\v 8 They cast lots for their duties, all equally, young and old, trained and untrained.
\v 9 The first lot fell to Joseph, an Asaphite, the second to
\pb Gedaliah (he and his fellows and his sons numbering twelve),
\v 10 the third to Zakkur with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 11 the fourth to Izri with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 12 the fifth to Nethaniah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 13 the sixth to Bukkiah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 14 the seventh to Asarelah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 15 the eighth to Jeshaiah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 16 the ninth to Mattaniah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 17 the tenth to Shimei with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 18 the eleventh to Uzziel with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 19 the twelfth to Hashablah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 20 the thirteenth to Shubael with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 21 the fourteenth to Mattithiah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 22 the fifteenth to Jerimoth with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 23 the sixteenth to Hananiah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 24 the seventeenth to Joshbekashah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 25 the eighteenth to Hanani with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 26 the nineteenth to Mallothi with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 27 the twentieth to Eliathah with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 28 the twenty-first to Hothir with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 29 the twenty-second to Giddalti with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 30 the twenty-third to Mahaziotli with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all),
\v 31 and the twenty-fourth to Romamtiezer with his sons and his fellows (twelve in all).
\c 26
\p
\v 1 The divisions of warders were as follows. Of the “Lf Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph; a Meshelemiah’s sons were Zech- ariah the eldest, Jediael the sec­ond, Zebadiah the third, Jath- niel the fourth, Elam the fifth, 3 Jehohanan the sixth, and Elie- hoenai the seventh. Obed- 4 edom’s sons (for Ged blessed him with sons) were Shemaiah the eldest, Jehozabad the second, Joab the third, Sakar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, Ammiel the 5 sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth; She- 6 maiah his son was also the father of sons who ruled their ancestral family, for they were sturdy men—Othni, Rephael, 7 Obed, Elzabad and his two brothers Elihu and Semachiah, men of might; all these belonged 8 to Obed-edom’s family, they and their sons and their fellows from Obed-edom amounting to sixty-two members of the serv­ice, stout, competent men. (Meshelemiah had eighteen sons 9 and fellows, sturdy men.) Hosa 10 the Merarite had also sons, Shimri being headman (for his father made him headman, though he was not the eldest), Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah 11 the third, and Zecharlah the fourth, Hosa’s sons and fellows numbering thirteen. These 12 provided the divisions of the warders, headmen who had the same duties as their fellows in the service of the temple of the Eternal. They cast lots, young 13 and old alike, by their families, for each gate. The lot for the 14 east gate fell to Meshelemiah; then lots were cast for his son Zechariah, a shrewd councillor,
and to Mm fell the north gate,
\v 11 	to Obed-edom the south gate (Ms sons being assigned the
\v 12 	storehouse), and to Hosa the west gate (beside the entry at
\v 13 	the ascent) with its wards. Six Levites were on duty daily east­ward, four northward, four southward, two at each door of
\v 14 	the storehouse, and at the western colonnade of the An­nexe, four at the causeway and two at the colonnade itself.
\v 15 	Such were the divisions of the warders, Korahites and Mera-
\v 16 	rites. As for their fellow- Levites who supervised the stores of the temple of God and the stores of votive offerings—
\v 17 	JeMel, and his brothers Zetham and Joel, headmen of the Ladan-
\v 18 	ite family, descendants of the Gershonites through Ladan, su­pervised the stores of the temple
\v 19 	of the Eternal. Of the Amram- ites, Izharites, Hebronites, and
\v 20 	Uzzielites, Shubael son of Ger- shom, son of Moses, managed the
\v 21 	storehouses; his kinsmen were Eliezer’s sons Rehabiah, Je- shaiah, Joram, Zichri, and Shelo-
\v 22 	moth. This Shelomoth and Ms brothers were in charge of all the store of votive offerings made by David the king and the headmen, the generals, com­manders, and army captains; anything thus dedicated was in charge of Shelomoth and his
\v 23 	Mothers. Part of the plunder taken in battle had been dedi­cated for the upkeep of the
\v 24 	temple of the Eternal; and all that had been dedicated by Sam­uel the seer, by Saul the son of Kish, by Abner the son of Ner, and by Joab the son of Zeruiah, everything thus dedicated was in charge of Shelomoth and his
\v 25 	brothers. Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and Ms sons acted
as sheriffs and judges, manag­ing the external affairs of Israel.
Of the Hebromtes, Hashablah 30 and his fellows, one thousand seven hundred braves, were in charge of Israel west of the Jordan, attending to all the interests of the Eternal and to the service of the king. The 31 Hebronites were led by Jerijah; he and his fellows amounted to 32 two thousand seven hundred braves, headmen whom David had appointed over the Reu- berntes, the Gadites, and the half-clan of Manasseh, to look after all the affairs of God and the business of the king. (The 31 various families of the Hebron­ites were picked out in the fortieth year of David’s reign, when brave warriors in their number were found at Jazer in Gilead.)
The Israelites, that is, the headmen, generals," • commanders, and all officers in the king’s service throughout all the divisions of the army, who served month by month through­out the year, amounted to twenty-four thousand. The first 2 division was commanded during the first month by Ishbaal the son of Zabdiel, who led twenty- four thousand men; he was a de- 3 scendant of Perez and com- mander-in-cMef for the first month. The division for the 4 second month w'as led by Elea- zar the son of Dodai the Aho- hite, over twenty-four thousand men. The tMrd general during 5 the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a priest who led twenty-four thousand men. (He was the Benaiah who 6 was the hero of the Thirty and in command of the TMrty, and Ms son Ammizabad belonged to Ms division.) The fourth 7
general during the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab (who was succeeded by his son Zebadiah), over twenty-four
\v 8 	thousand men. The fifth gen­eral during the fifth month was Shamhuth the Zerahite, over
\v 9 	twenty-four thousand men. The sixth general during the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, over twenty-four
\v 10 	thousand men. The seventh general during the seventh month was Ilelez the Pelonite, from Ephraim; his division numbered twenty-four thousand
\v 11 	men. The eighth general during the eighth month was Sibbechai the Hushathite, a descendant of Zerah; his division numbered twenty-four thousand men.
\v 12 	The ninth general during the ninth month was Abiezer, a Benjamite from Anathoth; his division numbered twenty-four
\v 13 	thousand men. The tenth gen­eral during the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, a de­scendant of Zerah; his division numbered twenty-four thousand
\v 14 	men. The eleventh general dur­ing the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, from Ephraim; his division numbered twenty-four thousand men.
\v 15 	The twelfth general during the twelfth month was Heled the Netophathite, a descendant of Othniel; his division numbered twenty-four thousand men.
\v 16 	In command of the clans of Israel were Eliezer son of Zichri, who ruled the Reubenites, the Simeonites being ruled by She-
\v 17 	phatiah son of Maakah, the Levites by Hashablah son of Kemuel, the Aaronites by Za-
\v 18 dok, the Judahites by Efihu a brother of David, the Issacha- rites by Omri son of Michael,
\v 19 the Zebulunites by Ishmaiah
son of Obadiah, the Naphtalites by Jerimoth son of Azriel, the 20 Ephraimites by Hoshea son of Azaziah, the half-clan of Manas- 21 seh by Joel son of Pedaiali, the half-clan of Manasseh in Gilead by Iddo son of Zecharlah, the Benjamites by Jaasiel son of Abner, and the Danites by Aza- 22 rel son of Jeroham. These were in command of the clans of Israel. David never took a 23 census of men under twenty years of age, since the Eternal had promised to make Israel as numerous as the stars in the sky. Joab the son of Zeruiah did be- 24 gin a census, but he never fin­ished it; his attempt drew God’s wrath on Israel, and the census was never entered in the records of king David’s reign.
Azmaveth son of Adiel was 25 in charge of the king’s stores; Jonathan son of Uzziali was in charge of the stores in the country, in towns, villages, and castles; Ezri son of Chelub was 26 in charge of those engaged on field-work as tillers of the soil; Shimei the Ramathite looked 27 after the vineyards, and Zabdi the Sliiphmite took charge of the produce of the vineyards for the wine-cellars; Baal-hanan 28 the Gederite looked after the olives and sycomores in the low­lands, and Joash managed the cellars of oil; Shitrai the Shar- 29 onite looked after the herds that grazed in Sharon; Shaphat son of Adlai looked after the herds in the valleys; Obil the 30 Ishmaelite managed the camels; Jehdeiah the Meronothite man­aged the asses; and Jaziz the 31 Hagrite looked after the flocks.
All these were responsible for king David’s possessions.
Jonathan, David’s nephew, 32 was a councillor, an able and
learned man; Jehiel, the son of a Hachmonite, was tutor to the 33 king’s sons; Ahithophel was the king’s counsellor, and Hushai the Archite was the king’s con­fidential adviser (Ahithophel was succeeded by Jehoiada son of Benaiah, and by Abiathar); the commander-in-chief was Joab.
David assembled at Jeru­salem all the authorities of Israel, the chieftains of the clans, the officers who served the king in their divisions, the generals and commanders, the men in charge of all the royal property and possessions, together with the eunuchs and the heroes,
\v 2 	all the leading warriors. Then David rose to his feet and said:
“Listen, my brothers, my peo­ple, I myself intended to build a temple for the ark of the com­pact of the Eternal to rest in, as a footstool for our God; I had made preparations to build it,
\v 3 	but God said to me, ‘You shall not build a temple for me, for you are a man of war and you
\v 4 	have shed blood.’ However, the Eternal, the God of Israel, chose me out of all my family to be king over Israel for all time; for he chose Judah to be the leading clan, and from Judah my father’s family, and, from my father’s sons, he favoured me by making me king over all
\v 5 	Israel. Now of all my sons (for the Eternal has given me many) he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the Eter-
\v 6 	nal’s dominion over Israel, and he has told me, ‘Solomon your son shall build my temple and my courts, for I have chosen him to be a son to me, and I will
\v 7 	be a father to him; I will estab­lish his kingdom for all time, if
he loyally obeys my orders and regulations, as is done to-day.’ Now then, in face of all Israel, 8 the community of the Eternal, and in hearing of our God, I bid you keep and bethink yourselves of all the orders of the Eternal your God, that you may hold this fine land as your own, and leave it as an inheritance to your children after you, for all time. As for you, Solomon my 9 son, care for the God of your father, serve him with an undi­vided heart and a willing mind; for the Eternal searches all hearts, he knows all that passes in the mind. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will aban­don you for ever. Take heed to io yourself; the Eternal has chosen you to build a temple as his sanctuary; be strong and do it.” David then handed to Solo- ii mon his son the plans of the porch, the various rooms, the side chambers, the upper cham­bers, the inner chambers, and the shrine for the ark and its cover; also the plans he had in 12 mind for the courts of the temple of the Eternal, and for all the outside chambers (store­houses for the temple of God and for the votive offerings, rooms 13 for the orders of priests and Le- vites, for any work connected with the service of the temple of the Eternal, and for all the ves­sels used in the service of the temple of the Eternal); and also 14 the weight of gold for all the va­rious golden vessels of the sacred service; with the weight of silver for all the various silver vessels of the sacred service. He also 15 fixed the weight of the golden lampstands and their lamps, respectively, and the weight of the silver lampstands and their
lamps, respectively, as befitted
\v 16 	each lampstand; fixed the weight of gold for each table of the Presence bread, and of silver
\v 17 	for the silver tables, of pure gold for the forks, basins, and jars; of gold for each golden tankard and of silver for each
\v 18 	silver tankard, of refined gold for the altar of incense, and of gold for the plan of the chariot —the kherubs with outstretched wings covering the ark of the
\v 19 	compact of the Eternal. “All this,” said David, “all these plans have I been inspired to write down by the Eternal, who has instructed me.”
\v 20 	Then David said to Solomon his son, “Be strong, take heart, and do it; never be daunted or dismayed, for the Eternal your God, even my God, is with you; he will never fail you nor forsake you before all the work needed for the temple of the Eternal is
\v 21 	finished. Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites, ready for all the service of the temple of God! And at every turn you will be supported by every willing, expert workman in every department; besides, the authorities and the whole of the nation will be entirely at your command.”
Then David the king ad­dressed all the assembly. “Solomon, my son, whom alone God has chosen,” he said, “is still young and inexperienced; and the work is great, for the palace is for God the Eternal, not for 2 man. I have prepared with all my might for the temple of my God, gold for the golden objects, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wooden, with jewels of beryl, jewels for set­ting, jewels for inlaid work,
jewels of all colours, with gems of all sorts, and plenty of mar­ble. Furthermore, in my devo- 3 tion to the temple of my God, as I possess a private treasure of gold and silver, I give it to the temple of my God, over and above what I have prepared for the sacred temple—namely, 4 two hundred and eighty-eight thousand pounds’ weight of gold from Ophir and six hundred and seventy-two thousand pounds’ weight of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the various buildings and to supply 5 gold for the golden objects and silver for the silver, to be used by the craftsmen for all such purposes. Now who will make a freewill offering to-day in devotion to the Eternal?”
Then the heads of the various 6 families and of the clans of Is­rael, the generals, the com­manders, and those in charge of the king’s business, made freewill offerings; they gave to the serv- 7 ice of the temple of God in gold four hundred and eighty thou­sand pounds’ weight, with ten thousand guineas in Persian dariks, in silver nine hundred and sixty thousand pounds’ weight, besides one million seven hundred and twenty-eight thou­sand pounds of bronze, and nine million six hundred thousand pounds of iron; those in pos- 8 session of jewels also contributed them to the treasure of the temple of the Eternal, in charge of Jehiel the Gershonite.
The people rejoiced at this, at 9 this freewill offering, contributed without grudging to the Eternal, and David the king was so over­joyed that he blessed the Eter­nal before all the assembly. “Blessed be thou, O Eternal, 10 God of our father Israel,” he
cried, “for ever and for ever.
\v 11 	Thine, O Eternal, is the great­ness and the power and the glory and the pre-eminence and the majesty, for all in heaven and earth is thine; thine is the dominion, O Eternal, and thine
\v 12 	the supreme authority! Riches and honour come from thee, who reignest over all; in thy hand lie power and might, and in thy hand it lies to make all great
\v 13 	and strong. Hence, O our God, we ever thank thee and praise
\v 14 	thy glorious name. Yet who am I, wThat is my people, that we should be able to offer such free­will offerings? All gifts come from thee, and we only give
\v 15 	thee what is thine. For we but come and go before thee upon earth, mere passing waifs, as all our fathers were; our days on earth flit like a shadow, without
\v 16 	hope. O thou Eternal, our God, all these stores which we have prepared to build thee a temple for thy sacred majesty, come from thine own hand and are
\v 17 	all thine own. My God, who dost test the heart and delight- est in honesty (I know), here in all honesty of heart have I offered all these gifts willingly, and watched with joy my peo­ple here offering to thee will-
\v 18 	ingly. O thou Eternal, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep the mind and pur­pose of thy people ever in this spirit; direct their hearts to
\v 19 	thyself, and grant that Solomon my son may ungrudgingly obey thine orders, thine injunctions, and thy rules, carrying them all out and building the palace for which I have made provision.”
\v 20 	Then David added, to the as­sembly, “Now bless the Eternal your God.” So the whole
assembly blessed the Eternal the God of their fathers, bending their heads and doing homage before God and the king; next 21 day they offered up sacrifices to the Eternal and made burnt- offerings to the Eternal, a thou­sand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with the usual libations and thank-offer­ings in abundance for all Israel, eating and drinking before the 22 Eternal that day with great gladness.
Then they made Solomon Da­vid’s son king a second time, consecrating him to be the prince of the Eternal, with Zadok as priest. So Solomon took his seat 23 on the throne of the Eternal as king, instead of his father Da­vid; he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him. All the authorities 24 and warriors and all the other sons of king David submitted to king Solomon. And the Eternal 25 exalted Solomon high in the sight of all Israel, investing him with a royal majesty such as no king before him in Israel had en­joyed.
Such was David’s reign over 26 all Israel. He reigned over Is- 27 rael for forty years, reigning seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
He died in a ripe old age, having 28 had life and riches and honour to the full, and Solomon his son reigned instead of him.
As for the deeds of David the 29 king, from first to last, they are described already in the History of Samuel the seer, the History of Nathan the prophet, and the History of Gad the seer, which 30 describe the whole of his reign, his exploits, and the changes that befell both him and Israel and all realms of the other countries.
