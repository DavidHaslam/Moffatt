\mt1 John
\c 1
\v 1  THE Logos existed in the very beginning, the Logos was with God, the Logos was divine. 
\v 2  He was with God in the very beginning: 
\v 3  through him all existence came into being, no existence came into being apart from him. 
\v 4  In him life lay, and this life was the Light for men: 
\v 5  amid the darkness the Light shone, but the darkness did not master it. 
\v 6  A man appeared, sent by God, whose name was John: 
\v 7  he came for the purpose of witnessing, to bear testimony to the Light, so that all men might believe by means of him. 
\v 8  He was not the Light; it was to bear testimony to the Light that he appeared. 
\v 9  The real Light, which enlightens every man, was coming then into the world: 
\v 10  he entered the world — the world which existed through him — yet the world did not recognize him; 
\v 11  he came to what was his own, yet his own folk did not welcome him. 
\v 12  On those who have accepted him, however, he has conferred the right of being children of God, that is, on those who believe in his Name, 
\v 13  who owe this birth of theirs to God, not to human blood, nor to any impulse of the flesh or of man. 
\v 14  So the Logos became flesh and tarried among us; we have seen his glory — glory such as an only son enjoys from his father — seen it to be full of grace and reality. 
\v 15  (John testified to him with the cry, \qt1This was he of whom I said, my successor has taken precedence of me, for he preceded me.\qt1*) 
\v 16  For we have all been receiving grace after grace from his fulness; 
\v 17  while the Law was given through Moses, grace and reality are ours through Jesus Christ. 
\v 18  Nobody has ever seen God, but God has been unfolded by the divine One, the only Son, who lies upon the Father's breast. 
\v 19  Now here is John's testimony. When the Jews of Jerusalem despatched priests and Levites to ask him, \qt1Who are you?\qt1* 
\v 20  he frankly confessed — he did not deny it, he frankly confessed, \qt1I am not the Christ.\qt1* 
\v 21  They asked him, \qt1Then what are you? Elijah?\qt1* He said, \qt1I am not.\qt1* \qt1Are you the Prophet?\qt1* \qt1No,\qt1* he answered. 
\v 22  \qt1Then who are you?\qt1* they said; \qt1tell us, so that we can give some answer to those who sent us. What have you to say for yourself?\qt1* 
\v 23  He said, \qt1I am the voice of one who cries in the desert, \qt2level the way for the Lord\qt2* — as the prophet Isaiah said.\qt1* 
\v 24  Now it was some of the Pharisees who had been sent to him; 
\v 25  so they asked him, saying, \qt1Then why are you baptizing people, if you are neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?\qt1* 
\v 26  \qt1I am baptizing with water,\qt1* John replied, \qt1but my successor is among you, One whom you do not recognize, 
\v 27  and I am not fit to untie the string of his sandal.\qt1* 
\v 28  This took place at Bethany on the opposite side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
\v 29  Next day he observed Jesus coming towards him and exclaimed, \qt1Look, there is the lamb of God, who is to remove the sin of the world! 
\v 30  That is he of whom I said, \qt2The man who is to succeed me has taken precedence of me, for he preceded me.\qt2* 
\v 31  I myself did not recognize him; I only came to baptize with water, in order that he might be disclosed to Israel.\qt1* 
\v 32  And John bore this testimony also: \qt1I saw the Spirit descend like a dove from heaven and rest on him. 
\v 33  I myself did not recognize him, but He who sent me to baptize with water told me, \qt2He on whom you see the Spirit descending and resting, that is he who baptizes with the holy Spirit.\qt2* 
\v 34  Now I did see it, and I testify that he is the Son of God.\qt1* 
\v 35  Next day again John was standing with two of his disciples; 
\v 36  he gazed at Jesus as he walked about, and said, \qt1Look, there is the lamb of God!\qt1* 
\v 37  The two disciples heard what he said and went after Jesus. 
\v 38  Now Jesus turned, and when he observed them coming after him, he asked them, \qt1What do you want?\qt1* They replied, \qt1Rabbi\qt1* (which may be translated, \qt1teacher\qt1*), \qt1where are you staying?\qt1* 
\v 39  He said to them, \qt1Come and see.\qt1* So they went and saw where he stayed, and stayed with him the rest of that day — it was then about four in the afternoon. 
\v 40  One of the two men who heard what John said and went after Jesus was Andrew, the brother of Peter. 
\v 41  In the morning he met his brother Simon and told him, \qt1We have found the messiah\qt1* (which may be translated, \qt1Christ\qt1*). 
\v 42  He took him to Jesus; Jesus gazed at him and said, \qt1You are Simon, the son of John? Your name is to be Cephas\qt1* (meaning \qt1Peter\qt1* or \qt1rock\qt1*). 
\v 43  Next day Jesus determined to leave for Galilee; there he met Philip and told him, \qt1Follow me.\qt1* 
\v 44  Now Philip belonged to Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter; 
\v 45  he met Nathanael and told him, \qt1We have found him whom Moses wrote about in the Law, and also the prophets — it is Jesus, the son of Joseph, who comes from Nazaret.\qt1* 
\v 46  \qt1Nazaret!\qt1* said Nathanael, \qt1can anything good come out of Nazaret?\qt1* \qt1Come and see,\qt1* said Philip. 
\v 47  Jesus saw Nathanael approaching and said of him, \qt1Here is a genuine Israelite! There is no guile in him.\qt1* 
\v 48  Nathanael said to him, \qt1How do you know me?\qt1* Jesus answered, \qt1When you were under that fig tree, before ever Philip called you, I saw you.\qt1* 
\v 49  \qt1Rabbi,\qt1* said Nathanael, \qt1you are the Son of God, you are the king of Israel!\qt1* 
\v 50  Jesus answered, \qt1You believe because I told you I had seen you under that fig tree? You shall see more than that.\qt1* 
\v 51  He said to him, \qt1Truly, truly I tell you all, you shall see heaven open wide and God's angels ascending and descending upon the Son of man.\qt1* 
\c 2
\v 1  Two days later a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee; the mother of Jesus was present, 
\v 2  and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 
\v 3  As the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, \qt1They have no wine.\qt1* 
\v 4  \qt1Woman,\qt1* said Jesus, \qt1what have you to do with me? My time has not come yet.\qt1* 
\v 5  His mother said to the servants, \qt1Do whatever he tells you.\qt1* 
\v 6  Now six stone water-jars were standing there, for the Jewish rites of \qt1purification,\qt1* each holding about twenty gallons. 
\v 7  Jesus said, \qt1Fill up the jars with water.\qt1* So they filled them to the brim. 
\v 8  Then he said, \qt1Now draw some out, and take it to the manager of the feast.\qt1* They did so; 
\v 9  and when the manager of the feast tasted the water which had become wine, not knowing where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn it knew), he called the bridegroom 
\v 10  and said to him, \qt1Everybody serves the good wine first, and then the poorer wine after people have drunk freely; you have kept the good wine till now.\qt1* 
\v 11  Jesus performed this, the first of his Signs, at Cana in Galilee, thereby displaying his glory; and his disciples believed in him. 
\v 12  After this he travelled down to Capharnahum, with his mother and brothers and his disciples; they stayed there for a few days. 
\v 13  Now the Jewish passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
\v 14  There he found, seated inside the temple, dealers in cattle, sheep and pigeons, also money-changers. 
\v 15  Making a scourge of cords, he drove them all, sheep and cattle together, out of the temple, scattered the coins of the brokers and upset their tables, 
\v 16  and told the pigeon-dealers, \qt1Away with these! My Father's house is not to be turned into a shop!\qt1* 
\v 17  (His disciples recalled the scripture saying, I am consumed with zeal for thy house.) 
\v 18  Then the Jews accosted him with the words, \qt1What sign of authority have you to show us, for acting in this way?\qt1* 
\v 19  Jesus replied, \qt1Destroy this sanctuary and I will raise it up in three days.\qt1* 
\v 20  \qt1This sanctuary took forty-six years to build,\qt1* the Jews retorted, \qt1and you are going to raise it up in three days!\qt1* 
\v 21  He meant the sanctuary of his body, however, 
\v 22  and when the disciples recalled what he had said, after he had been raised from the dead, they believed the scripture and the word of Jesus. 
\v 23  When he was in Jerusalem at the festival of the passover, many people believed in his name, as they witnessed the Signs which he performed. 
\v 24  Jesus, however, would not trust himself to them; he knew all men, 
\v 25  and required no evidence from anyone about human nature; well did he know what was in human nature. 
\c 3
\v 1  Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who belonged to the Jewish authorities; 
\v 2  he came one night to Jesus and said, \qt1Rabbi, we know you have come from God to teach us, for no one could perform these Signs of yours unless God were with him.\qt1* 
\v 3  Jesus replied, \qt1Truly, truly I tell you, no one can see God's Realm unless he is born from above.\qt1* 
\v 4  Nicodemus said to him, \qt1How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter his mother's womb over again and be born?\qt1* 
\v 5  Jesus replied, \qt1Truly, truly I tell you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter God's Realm. 
\v 6  What is born of the flesh is flesh: what is born of the Spirit is Spirit. 
\v 7  Do not wonder at me telling you, \qt2You must all be born from above.\qt2* 
\v 8  The wind blows where it wills; you can hear its sound, but you never know where it has come from or where it goes: it is the same with everyone who is born of the Spirit.\qt1* 
\v 9  Nicodemus answered, \qt1How can that be?\qt1* 
\v 10  Jesus replied, \qt1You do not understand this? — you, a teacher in Israel! 
\v 11  Truly, truly I tell you, we are speaking of what we do understand, we testify to what we have actually seen — and yet you refuse our testimony. 
\v 12  If you will not believe when I speak to you about things on earth, how will you believe if I speak to you about things in heaven? 
\v 13  And yet the Son of man, descended from heaven, is the only one who has ever ascended into heaven. 
\v 14  Indeed the Son of man must be lifted on high, just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, 
\v 15  that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. 
\v 16  For God loved the world so dearly that he gave up his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life, instead of perishing. 
\v 17  God did not send his Son into the world to pass sentence on it, but to save the world by him. 
\v 18  He who believes in him is not sentenced; he who will not believe is sentenced already, for having refused to believe in the name of the only Son of God. 
\v 19  And this is the sentence of condemnation, that the Light has entered the world and yet men have preferred darkness to light. It is because their actions have been evil; 
\v 20  for anyone whose practices are corrupt loathes the light and will not come out into it, in case his actions are exposed, 
\v 21  whereas anyone whose life is true comes out into the light, to make it plain that his actions have been divinely prompted. 
\v 22  [vss 22-30 moved to between 2:12 and 2:13] After this Jesus and his disciples went into the country of Judaea, where he spent some time with them baptizing. 
\v 23  John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, as there was plenty of water there, and people came to him and were baptized 
\v 24  (John had not yet been thrown into prison). 
\v 25  Now a dispute arose between John's disciples and a Jew over the question of \qt2purification\qt2*; 
\v 26  and they came and told John, \qt1*Rabbi, the man who was with you on the opposite side of the Jordan, the man to whom you bore testimony — here he is, baptizing, and everybody goes to him!\qt1 
\v 27  John answered, \qt1*No one can receive anything except as a gift from heaven. 
\v 28  You can bear me out, that I said, \qt1I am not the Christ\qt1*; what I said was, \qt1I have been sent in advance of him.\qt1* 
\v 29  He who has the bride is the bridegroom; the bridegroom's friend, who stands by and listens to him, is heartily glad at the sound of the bridegroom's voice. Such is my joy, and it is complete. 
\v 30  He must wax, I must wane.\qt1 
\v 31  He who comes from above is far above all others; he who springs from earth belongs to earth and speaks of earth; he who comes from heaven [is far above all others. 
\v 32  He] is testifying to what he has seen and heard, and yet no one accepts his testimony. 
\v 33  Whoever does accept it, certifies to the truth of God. 
\v 34  For he whom God has sent utters the words of God — God gives him the Spirit in no sparing measure; 
\v 35  the Father loves the Son and has given him control over everything. 
\v 36  He who believes in the Son has eternal life, but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life — God's anger broods over him.\qt1* 
\c 4
\v 1  Now when the Lord learned that the Pharisees had heard of Jesus gaining and baptizing more disciples than John 
\v 2  (though Jesus himself did not baptize, it was his disciples), 
\v 3  he left Judaea and went back to Galilee. 
\v 4  He had to pass through Samaria, 
\v 5  and in so doing he arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar; it lay near the territory which Jacob had given to his son Joseph, 
\v 6  and Jacob's spring was there. Jesus, exhausted by the journey, sat down at the spring, just as he was. It was about noon, 
\v 7  and a Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, \qt1Give me a drink\qt1* 
\v 8  (his disciples had gone to the town to buy some food). 
\v 9  The Samaritan woman said, \qt1What? You are a Jew, and you ask me for a drink — me, a Samaritan!\qt1* (Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) 
\v 10  Jesus answered, \qt1If you knew what is the free gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked him instead, and he would have given you \qt2living\qt2* water.\qt1* 
\v 11  \qt1Sir,\qt1* said the woman, \qt1you have nothing to draw water with, and it is a deep well; where do you get your \qt2living\qt2* water? 
\v 12  Are you a greater man than Jacob, our ancestor? He gave us this well, and he drank from it, with his sons and his cattle.\qt1* 
\v 13  Jesus answered, \qt1Anyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, 
\v 14  but anyone who drinks the water I shall give him will never thirst any more; the water I shall give him will turn into a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\qt1* 
\v 15  \qt1Ah, sir,\qt1* said the woman, \qt1give me this water, so that I need not thirst or come all this road to draw water.\qt1* 
\v 16  Jesus said to her, \qt1Go and call your husband, then come back here.\qt1* 
\v 17  The woman replied, \qt1I have no husband.\qt1* Jesus said to her, \qt1You were right in saying, \qt2I have no husband\qt2*; 
\v 18  you have had five husbands, and he whom you have now espoused is not your husband. That was a true word.\qt1* 
\v 19  \qt1Sir,\qt1* said the woman, \qt1I see you are a prophet. 
\v 20  Now our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, whereas you Jews declare the proper place for worship is at Jerusalem.\qt1* 
\v 21  \qt1Woman,\qt1* said Jesus, \qt1believe me, the time is coming when you will be worshipping the Father neither on this mountain nor at Jerusalem. 
\v 22  You are worshipping something you do not know; we are worshipping what we do know — for salvation comes from the Jews. 
\v 23  But the time is coming, it has come already, when the real worshippers will worship the Father in Spirit and in reality; for these are the worshippers that the Father wants. 
\v 24  God is Spirit, and his worshippers must worship him in Spirit and in reality.\qt1* 
\v 25  The woman said to him, \qt1Well, I know messiah (which means Christ) is coming. When he arrives, he will explain it all to us.\qt1* 
\v 26  \qt1I am messiah,\qt1* said Jesus, \qt1I who am talking to you.\qt1* 
\v 27  At this point his disciples came up; they were surprised that he was talking to a woman, but none of them said, \qt1What is it?\qt1* or, \qt1Why are you talking to her?\qt1* 
\v 28  Then the woman left her water-pot, and going off to the town told the people, 
\v 29  \qt1Come here, look at a man who has told me everything I ever did! Can he be the Christ?\qt1* 
\v 30  They set out from the town on their way to him. 
\v 31  Meanwhile the disciples pressed him, saying, \qt1Rabbi, eat something.\qt1* 
\v 32  But he said to them, \qt1I have food, of which you know nothing.\qt1* 
\v 33  So the disciples asked each other, \qt1Can anyone have brought him something to eat?\qt1* 
\v 34  Jesus said, \qt1My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work. 
\v 35  You have a saying, have you not, \qt2Four months yet, then harvest\qt2*? Look round, I tell you; see, the fields are white for harvesting! 
\v 36  The reaper is already getting his wages and harvesting for eternal life, so that the sower shares the reaper's joy. 
\v 37  That proverb, \qt2One sows and another reaps,\qt2* holds true here: 
\v 38  I sent you to reap a crop for which you did not toil; other men have toiled, and you reap the profit of their toil.\qt1* 
\v 39  Now many Samaritans belonging to that town believed in him on account of the woman's testimony, \qt1He told me everything I ever did.\qt1* 
\v 40  So when the Samaritans arrived, they pressed him to stay with them; he did stay there two days, 
\v 41  and far more of them believed on account of what he said himself. 
\v 42  As they told the woman, \qt1We no longer believe on account of what you said; we have heard for ourselves, we know that he is really the Saviour of the world.\qt1* 
\v 43  When the two days were over, he left for Galilee 
\v 44  (for Jesus himself testified that a prophet enjoys no honour in his own country); 
\v 45  on reaching Galilee, he was welcomed by the Galileans, who had seen all he did at the festival in Jerusalem — for they too had gone to the festival. 
\v 46  Once more he came to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. There was a royal official, whose son was lying ill at Capernaum; 
\v 47  when he heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judaea, he went to him and begged him to come down and cure his son, who was at the point of death. 
\v 48  Jesus said to him, \qt1Unless you see signs and wonders, you never will believe.\qt1* 
\v 49  The official said, \qt1Come down, sir, before my boy is dead.\qt1* 
\v 50  Jesus told him, \qt1Go yourself, your son is alive.\qt1* The man believed what Jesus told him, and started on his journey. 
\v 51  And on the road his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive. 
\v 52  So he asked them at what hour he had begun to improve; they told him, \qt1Yesterday at one o'clock the fever left him.\qt1* 
\v 53  Then the father realized that it had left him at the very time when Jesus had said to him, \qt1Your son is alive\qt1*; and he became a believer with all his household. 
\v 54  This was the second Sign which Jesus performed again after leaving Judaea for Galilee. 
\c 5
\v 1  After this there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
\v 2  Now in Jerusalem there is a bath beside the sheep-pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethzatha; it has five porticoes, 
\v 3  where a crowd of invalids used to lie, the blind, the lame, and folk with shrivelled limbs [waiting for the water to bubble. 
\v 4  For an angel used to descend from time to time into the bath, and disturb the water; whereupon the first person who stepped in after the water was disturbed was restored to health, no matter what disease he had been afflicted with]. 
\v 5  Now one man was there, whose illness had lasted thirty-eight years. 
\v 6  Jesus saw him lying, and knowing he had been ill for a long while he said to him, \qt1Do you want your health restored?\qt1* 
\v 7  The invalid replied, \qt1Sir, I have nobody to put me into the bath, when the water is disturbed; and while I am getting down myself, someone else gets in before me.\qt1* 
\v 8  Jesus said to him, \qt1Get up, lift your mat, and walk.\qt1* 
\v 9  And instantly the man got well, lifted his mat, and started to walk. Now it was the sabbath on that day. 
\v 10  So the Jews said to the man who had been cured, \qt1This is the sabbath, you have no right to be carrying your mat.\qt1* 
\v 11  He replied, \qt1But the man who healed me, he told me, \qt2Lift your mat and walk\qt2*.\qt1* 
\v 12  They questioned him, \qt1Who was it that told you, \qt2Lift it and walk\qt2*?\qt1* 
\v 13  Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for (owing to the crowd on the spot) Jesus had slipped away. 
\v 14  Later on Jesus met him in the temple, and said to him, \qt1See, you are well and strong; commit no more sins, in case something worse befalls you.\qt1* 
\v 15  Off went the man and told the Jews it was Jesus who had healed him. 
\v 16  And this was why the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did things like this on the sabbath. 
\v 17  The reply of Jesus was, \qt1As my Father has continued working to this hour, so I work too.\qt1* 
\v 18  But this only made the Jews more eager to kill him, because he not merely broke the sabbath but actually spoke of God as his own Father, thereby making himself equal to God. 
\v 19  So Jesus made this answer to them: \qt1Truly, truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, nothing but what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, the Son also does the same. 
\v 20  The Father loves the Son and shows him all that he is doing himself. He will show him still greater deeds than these, to make you wonder; 
\v 21  for as the Father raises the dead and makes them live, so the Son makes anyone live whom he chooses. 
\v 22  Indeed the Father passes judgment on no one; he has committed the judgment which determines life or death entirely to the Son, 
\v 23  that all men may honour the Son as they honour the Father. (He who does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who sent him.) 
\v 24  Truly, truly I tell you, he who listens to my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life; he will incur no sentence of judgment, he has already passed from death across to life. 
\v 25  Truly, truly I tell you, the time is coming, it has come already, when the dead will listen to the voice of the Son of God, and those who listen will live; 
\v 26  for as the Father has life in himself, so too he has granted the Son to have life in himself, 
\v 27  and also granted him authority to act as judge, since he is Son of man. 
\v 28  Do not wonder at this; for there is a time coming when all who are in the tombs will listen to his voice 
\v 29  and come out, the doers of good to be raised to life, ill-doers to be raised for the sentence of judgment. 
\v 30  I can do nothing of my own accord; I pass judgment on men as I am taught by God, and my judgment is just, because my aim is not my own will but the will of him who sent me. 
\v 31  If I testify to myself, then my evidence is not valid; 
\v 32  I have Another to bear testimony to me, and I know the evidence he bears for me is valid. 
\v 33  You sent to John, and he bore testimony to the truth 
\v 34  (though I accept no testimony from man — I only speak of this testimony, that you may be saved); 
\v 35  he was a burning and a shining lamp, and you chose to rejoice for a while in his light. 
\v 36  But I possess a testimony greater than that of John, for the deeds which the Father has granted me to accomplish, the very deeds on which I am engaged, are my testimony that the Father has sent me. 
\v 37  The Father who sent me has also borne testimony to me himself; but his voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen, 
\v 38  his word you have not kept with you, because you do not believe him whom he sent. 
\v 39  You search the scriptures, imagining you possess eternal life in their pages — and they do testify to me — 
\v 40  but you refuse to come to me for life. 
\v 41  I accept no credit from men, 
\v 42  but I know there is no love to God in you; 
\v 43  here am I, come in the name of my Father, and you will not accept me: let someone else come in his own name, and you will accept him! 
\v 44  How can you believe, you who accept credit from one another instead of aiming at the credit which comes from the only God? 
\v 45  Do not imagine I am going to accuse you to the Father; Moses is your accuser, Moses who is your hope! 
\v 46  For if you believed Moses you would believe me, since it was of me that he wrote. 
\v 47  But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you ever believe what I say?\qt1* 
\c 6
\v 1  After this Jesus went off to the opposite side of the sea of Galilee (the lake of Tiberias), 
\v 2  followed by a large crowd on account of the Signs which they had seen him perform on sick folk. 
\v 3  Now Jesus went up the hill and sat down there with his disciples. 
\v 4  (The passover, the Jewish festival, was at hand.) 
\v 5  On looking up and seeing a large crowd approaching, he said to Philip, \qt1Where are we to buy bread for all these people to eat?\qt1* 
\v 6  (He said this to test Philip, for he knew what he was going to do himself.) 
\v 7  Philip answered, \qt1Seven pounds\qt2 worth of bread would not be enough for them, for everybody to get even a morsel.\qt3 
\v 8  One of his disciples, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter, said to him, 
\v 9  \qt3*There is a servant here, with five barley-cakes and a couple of fish; but what is that among so many?\qt3 
\v 10  Jesus said, \qt3*Get the people to lie down.\qt3 Now there was plenty of grass at the spot, so the men lay down, numbering about five thousand. 
\v 11  Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks to God, and distributed them to those who were reclining; so too with the fish, as much as they wanted. 
\v 12  And when they were satisfied, he said to the disciples, \qt3*Gather up the pieces left over, so that nothing may be wasted.\qt3 
\v 13  They gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with pieces of the five loaves left over from the meal. 
\v 14  Now when the people saw the Sign he had performed, they said, \qt3*This really is the Prophet who is to come into the world!\qt3 
\v 15  Whereupon Jesus perceived they meant to come and seize him to make a king of him; so he withdrew by himself to the hill again. 
\v 16  When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, 
\v 17  and embarking in a boat they started across the sea for Capharnahum. By this time it was dark, Jesus had not reached them yet, 
\v 18  and the sea was getting up under a strong wind. 
\v 19  After rowing about three or four miles they saw Jesus walking on the sea and nearing the boat. They were terrified, 
\v 20  but he said to them, \qt3*It is I, have no fear\qt3; 
\v 21  so they agreed to take him on board, and the boat instantly reached the land they were making for. 
\v 22  Next day the crowd which had been left standing on the other side of the sea bethought them that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not gone aboard with his disciples, who had left by themselves. 
\v 23  So, as some boats from Tiberias had put in near the spot where they had eaten bread after the Lord's thanksgiving, 
\v 24  and as the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they embarked in the boats themselves and made for Capharnahum in search of Jesus. 
\v 25  When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said, \qt3*Rabbi, when did you get here?\qt3 
\v 26  Jesus answered them, \qt3*Truly, truly I tell you, it is not because you saw Signs that you are in quest of me, but because you ate these loaves and had your fill. 
\v 27  Work for no perishing food, but for that lasting food which means eternal life; the Son of man will give you that, for the Father, God, has certified him.\qt3 
\v 28  Then they asked him, \qt3*What must we do to perform the works of God?\qt3 
\v 29  Jesus replied to them, \qt3*This is the work of God, to believe in him whom God has sent.\qt3 
\v 30  \qt3*Well then,\qt3 they said, \qt3*what is the Sign you perform, that we may see it and believe you? What work have you to show? 
\v 31  Our ancestors ate manna in the desert: as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.\qt3 
\v 32  Then said Jesus, \qt3*What Moses gave you was not the bread from heaven; it is my Father who gives you the real bread from heaven — 
\v 33  for the bread of God is what comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\qt3 
\v 34  \qt3*Ah, sir,\qt3 they said to him, \qt3*give us that bread always.\qt3 
\v 35  Jesus said, \qt3*I am the bread of life; he who comes to me will never be hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty again. 
\v 36  But, as I told you, though you have seen me, you do not believe. 
\v 37  All those will come to me who are the Father's gift to me, and never will I reject one of them; 
\v 38  for I have come down from heaven not to carry out my own will but the will of him who sent me, 
\v 39  and the will of him who sent me is that I lose none of those who are his gift to me, but that I raise them all up on the last day. 
\v 40  It is the will of my Father that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should possess eternal life, and that I should raise him up on the last day.\qt3 
\v 41  Now the Jews murmured at him for saying, \qt3*I am the bread which has come down from heaven.\qt3 
\v 42  They said, \qt3*Is this not Jesus the son of Joseph? We know his father and mother. How can he claim now, \qt2*I have come down from heaven\qt2?\qt3 
\v 43  Jesus replied to them, \qt3*Stop murmuring to yourselves. 
\v 44  No one is able to come to me unless he is drawn by the Father who sent me (and I will raise him up on the last day). 
\v 45  In the prophets it is written, and they will be all instructed by God; everyone who has listened to the Father and learned from him, comes to me. 
\v 46  Not that anyone has seen the Father — he only, who is from God, he has seen the Father. 
\v 47  Truly, truly I tell you, the believer has eternal life. 
\v 48  I am the bread of life. 
\v 49  Your ancestors ate manna in the desert, but they died; 
\v 50  the bread that comes down from heaven is such that one eats of it and never dies. 
\v 51  I am the living bread which has come down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and more, the bread I will give is my flesh, given for the life of the world.\qt3 
\v 52  The Jews then wrangled with one another, saying, \qt3*How can he give us his flesh to eat?\qt3 
\v 53  So Jesus said to them, \qt3*Truly, truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life within you. 
\v 54  He who feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood possesses eternal life (and I will raise him up on the last day), 
\v 55  for my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. 
\v 56  He who feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains within me, as I remain within him. 
\v 57  Just as the living Father sent me and I live by the Father, so he who feeds on me will also live by me. 
\v 58  Such is the bread which has come down from heaven: your ancestors ate their bread and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live for ever.\qt3 
\v 59  This he said as he taught in the synagogue at Capharnahum. 
\v 60  Now many of his disciples, on hearing it, said, \qt3*This is hard to take in! Who can listen to talk like this?\qt3 
\v 61  Jesus, inwardly conscious that his disciples were murmuring at it, said to them, \qt3*So this upsets you? 
\v 62  Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending to where he formerly existed? 
\v 63  What gives life is the Spirit: flesh is of no avail at all. The words I have uttered to you are spirit and life. 
\v 64  And yet there are some of you who do not believe\qt3 (for Jesus knew from the very first who the unbelieving were, and who was to betray him; 
\v 65  that was why he said \qt4I tell you that no one is able to come to me unless he is allowed by the Father\qt4*). 
\v 66  After that, many of his disciples drew back and would not associate with him any longer. 
\v 67  So Jesus said to the twelve, \qt3*You do not want to go, too?\qt3 
\v 68  Simon Peter answered him, \qt3*Lord, who are we to go to? You have got words of eternal life, 
\v 69  and we believe, we are certain, that you are the holy One of God.\qt3 
\v 70  Jesus answered them, \qt3*Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil!\qt3 
\v 71  (He meant Judas the son of Simon Iscariot; for Judas was to betray him — and he was one of the twelve.) 
\c 7
\v 1  After this Jesus moved about in Galilee; he would not move in Judaea, because the Jews were trying to kill him. 
\v 2  Now the Jewish festival of booths was near, 
\v 3  so his brothers said to him, \qt3*Leave this and go across into Judaea, to let your disciples witness what you can do; 
\v 4  for nobody who aims at public recognition ever keeps his actions secret. Since you can do these deeds, display yourself to the world\qt3 
\v 5  (for even his brothers did not believe in him). 
\v 6  Jesus said to them, \qt3*My time has not come yet, but your time is always at hand; 
\v 7  the world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its deeds are evil. 
\v 8  Go up to the festival yourselves; I am not going up to this festival, for my time has not arrived yet.\qt3 
\v 9  So saying, he stayed on in Galilee. 
\v 10  But after his brothers had gone up to the festival, he went up too, not publicly but as it were privately. 
\v 11  At the festival the Jews were in quest of him, saying, \qt3*Where is he?\qt3 
\v 12  And the crowd disputed about him hotly; some said, \qt3*He is a good man,\qt3 but others said, \qt3*No, he is misleading the people.\qt3 
\v 13  For fear of the Jews, however, nobody spoke of him in public. 
\v 14  When the festival was half over, Jesus went up to the temple and began to teach. 
\v 15  [vss 15 to 24 placed after 5:47] The Jews were amazed, saying, \qt3*How can this uneducated fellow manage to read?\qt3 
\v 16  Jesus told them in reply, \qt3*My teaching is not my own but his who sent me; 
\v 17  anyone who chooses to do his will, shall understand whether my teaching comes from God or whether I am talking on my own authority. 
\v 18  He who talks on his own authority aims at his own credit, but he who aims at the credit of the person who sent him, he is sincere, and there is no dishonesty in him. 
\v 19  Did not Moses give you the Law? — and yet none of you honestly obeys the Law. Else, why do you want to kill me?\qt3 
\v 20  The crowd replied, \qt3*You are mad. Who wants to kill you?\qt3 
\v 21  Jesus answered them, \qt3*I have only performed one deed, and yet you are all amazed at it. 
\v 22  Moses gave you the rite of circumcision (not that it came from Moses, it came from your ancestors), and you will circumcise a man upon the sabbath. 
\v 23  Well, if a man gets circumcised upon the sabbath, to avoid breaking the Law of Moses, are you enraged at me for curing, not cutting, the entire body of a man upon the sabbath? 
\v 24  Give over judging by appearances; be just.\qt3 
\v 25  Then said some of the Jerusalemites, \qt3*Is this not the man they want to kill? 
\v 26  Yet here he is, opening his lips in public, and they say nothing to him! Can the authorities have really discovered that he is the Christ? 
\v 27  No, we know where this man comes from; but when the Christ does come, no one will know where he comes from.\qt3 
\v 28  So Jesus cried aloud, as he was teaching in the temple, \qt3*You know me? you know where I come from? But I have not come on my own initiative; I am sent, and sent by Him who is real. You do not know Him, 
\v 29  but I know Him, because I have come from Him and He sent me.\qt3 
\v 30  So they tried to arrest him; but no one laid hands on him, because his time had not come yet. 
\v 31  Indeed many of the people believed in him, saying, \qt3*When the Christ does come, will he perform more Signs than this man?\qt3 
\v 32  The Pharisees heard the people discussing Jesus in this way, so the high priests and the Pharisees despatched attendants to arrest him. 
\v 33  Then said Jesus, \qt3*I will be with you a little longer, then I go to Him who sent me; 
\v 34  you will search for me but you will not find me, and where I go, you cannot come.\qt3 
\v 35  The Jews said to themselves, \qt3*Where is he going, that we will not find him? Is he off to the Dispersion among the Greeks, to teach the Greeks? 
\v 36  What does he mean by saying, \qt2*You will search for me but you will not find me, and where I go, you cannot come\qt2?\qt3 
\v 37  Now on the last day, the great day, of the festival, Jesus stood and cried aloud, \qt3*If anyone is athirst, let him come to me and drink; 
\v 38  he who believes in me — out of his body, as scripture says, streams of living water will flow\qt3 
\v 39  (he meant by this the Spirit which those who believed in him were to receive: — as yet there was no Spirit, because Jesus had not been glorified yet). 
\v 40  On hearing this some of the people said, \qt3*This really is the Prophet\qt3; 
\v 41  others said, \qt3*He is the Christ\qt3; but others said, \qt3*No, surely the Christ does not come from Galilee? 
\v 42  Does not scripture say it is from the offspring of David, from David's village of Bethlehem, that the Christ is to come?\qt3 
\v 43  So the people were divided over him; 
\v 44  some wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him. 
\v 45  Then the attendants went back to the high priests and Pharisees, who asked them, \qt3*Why have you not brought him with you?\qt3 
\v 46  The attendants replied, \qt3*No man ever spoke as he does.\qt3 
\v 47  The Pharisees retorted, \qt3*Are you misled as well? 
\v 48  Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him? 
\v 49  As for this mob, with its ignorance of the Law — it is accursed!\qt3 
\v 50  Nicodemus, one of their number (the same who had come to him before), said to them, 
\v 51  \qt3*But surely our Law does not condemn the accused before hearing what he has to say and ascertaining his offence?\qt3 
\v 52  They answered him, \qt3*And are you from Galilee, too? Search and you will see that no prophet ever springs from Galilee.\qt3 
\v 53  [And everyone of them went home, 
\c 8
\v 1  but Jesus went to the Hill of Olives. 
\v 2  Early in the morning he returned to the temple, the people all came to him, and he sat down and taught them. 
\v 3  The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in the act of committing adultery, and making her stand forward 
\v 4  they said to him, \qt3*Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. 
\v 5  Now Moses has commanded us in the Law to stone such creatures; but what do you say?\qt3 
\v 6  (They said this to test him, in order to get a charge against him.) Jesus stooped down, and began to write with his finger on the ground; 
\v 7  but as they persisted with their question, he raised himself and said to them, \qt3*Let the innocent among you throw the first stone at her\qt3; 
\v 8  then he stooped down again and wrote on the ground. 
\v 9  And on hearing what he said, they went away one by one, beginning with the older men, till Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 
\v 10  Looking up, Jesus said to her, \qt3*Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\qt3 
\v 11  She said, \qt3*No one, sir.\qt3 Jesus said, \qt3*Neither do I; be off, and never sin again.\qt3] 
\v 12  Then Jesus again addressed them, saying, \qt3*I am the light of the world: he who follows me will not walk in darkness, he will enjoy the light of life.\qt3 
\v 13  So the Pharisees said to him, \qt3*You are testifying to yourself; your evidence is not valid.\qt3 
\v 14  Jesus replied to them, \qt3*Though I do testify to myself, my evidence is valid, because I know where I have come from and where I am going to — whereas you do not know where I have come from or where I am going to. 
\v 15  You judge by the outside. I judge no one; 
\v 16  and though I do judge, my judgment is true, because I am not by myself — there is myself and the Father who sent me. 
\v 17  Why, it is written in your own Law that the evidence of two persons is valid: 
\v 18  I testify to myself, and the Father who sent me also testifies to me.\qt3 
\v 19  \qt3*Where is your Father?\qt3 they said. Jesus replied, \qt3*You know neither me nor my Father; if you had known me you would have known my Father also.\qt3 
\v 20  These words he spoke in the treasury, as he was teaching in the temple, but no one arrested him, because his time had not come yet. 
\v 21  Then he said to them again, \qt3*I go away, and you will search for me, but you will die in your sin; where I go, you cannot come.\qt3 
\v 22  So the Jews said, \qt3*Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, \qt2*Where I go, you cannot come\qt2?\qt3 
\v 23  He said to them, \qt3*You are from the world below, I am from the world above: you belong to this world, I do not belong to this world. 
\v 24  So I told you, you would die in your sins; for unless you believe who I am, you will die in your sins.\qt3 
\v 25  They said, \qt3*Who are you?\qt3 Jesus replied, \qt3*Why should I talk to you at all? 
\v 26  I have a great deal to say about you and many a judgment to pass upon you; but he who sent me is true, and so I tell the world what I have learned from him.\qt3 
\v 27  They did not understand he was speaking to them about the Father; 
\v 28  so Jesus said, \qt3*When you have lifted up the Son of man, you will know then who I am, and that I do nothing of my own accord, but speak as the Father has taught me. 
\v 29  He who sent me is at my side; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.\qt3 
\v 30  As he said this, a number believed in him. 
\v 31  So Jesus addressed the Jews who had believed him, saying, \qt3*If you abide by what I say, you are really disciples of mine: 
\v 32  you will understand the truth, and the truth will set you free.\qt3 
\v 33  \qt3*We are Abraham's offspring,\qt3 they retorted, \qt3*we have never been slaves to anybody. What do you mean by saying, \qt2*You will be free\qt2?\qt3 
\v 34  Jesus replied, \qt3*Truly, truly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave. 
\v 35  Now the slave does not remain in the household for all time; the son of the house does. 
\v 36  So, if the Son sets you free, you will be really free. 
\v 37  I know you are Abraham's offspring! Yet you want to kill me, since my word makes no headway among you! 
\v 38  I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you act as you have learned from your father.\qt3 
\v 39  They answered him, \qt3*Abraham is our father.\qt3 \qt3*If you are Abraham's children,\qt3 said Jesus, \qt3*then do as Abraham did; 
\v 40  but now you want to kill me — to kill a man who has told you the truth, the truth I have learned from God. Abraham did not do that. 
\v 41  You do the deeds of your father.\qt3 They said to him, \qt3*We are no bastards: we have one father, even God.\qt3 
\v 42  Said Jesus, \qt3*If God were your father, you would love me, for I came here from God; I did not come of my own accord, I was sent by him. 
\v 43  Why do you not understand my speech? Because you are unable to listen to what I am saying. 
\v 44  You belong to your father the devil, and you want to do what your father desires; he was a slayer of men from the very beginning, and he has no place in the truth because there is no truth in him: when he tells a lie, he is expressing his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. 
\v 45  It is because I tell the truth, that you do not believe me. 
\v 46  Which of you can convict me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? 
\v 47  He who belongs to God listens to the words of God; you do not listen to them, because you do not belong to God.\qt3 
\v 48  The Jews retorted, \qt3*Are we not right in saying you are a Samaritan, you are mad?\qt3 
\v 49  Jesus replied, \qt3*I am not mad: I honour my Father and you dishonour me. 
\v 50  However, I do not aim at my own credit; there is One who cares for my credit, and he is judge. 
\v 51  Truly, truly I tell you, if anyone holds to what I say, he will never see death.\qt3 
\v 52  The Jews said to him, \qt3*Now we are sure you are mad. Abraham is dead, and so are all the prophets; and you declare, \qt2*If anyone holds to what I say, he will never taste death\qt2! 
\v 53  Are you greater than our father Abraham? He is dead, and the prophets are dead. Who do you claim to be?\qt3 
\v 54  Jesus replied, \qt3*Were I to glorify myself, my glory would be nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me; you say \qt2*He is our God,\qt2 
\v 55  but you do not understand him. I know him. Were I to say, \qt2*I do not know him,\qt2 I would be a liar like yourselves; but I do know him and I hold to his word. 
\v 56  Your father Abraham exulted that he was to see my Day: he did see it and he rejoiced.\qt3 
\v 57  Then said the Jews to him, \qt3*You are not fifty years old, and Abraham has seen you?\qt3 
\v 58  \qt3*Truly, truly I tell you,\qt3 said Jesus, \qt3*I have existed before Abraham was born.\qt3 
\v 59  At this they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus concealed himself and made his way out of the temple. 
\c 9
\v 1  As he passed along he saw a man who had been blind from his birth; 
\v 2  and his disciples asked him, \qt3*Rabbi, for whose sin — for his own or for his parents\qt2* — was he born blind?\qt1* 
\v 3  Jesus replied, \qt1Neither for his own sin nor for his parents\qt2 — it was to let the work of God be illustrated in him. 
\v 4  While daylight lasts, we must be busy with the work of God: night comes, when no one can do any work. 
\v 5  When I am in the world, I am light for the world.\qt3 
\v 6  With these words he spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva, which he smeared on the man's eyes, 
\v 7  saying, \qt3*Go and wash them in the pool of Siloam\qt3 (Siloam meaning \qt4sent\qt4*). So off he went and washed them, and went home seeing. 
\v 8  Whereupon the neighbours and those to whom he had been a familiar sight as a beggar, said, \qt3*Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?\qt3 
\v 9  Some said, \qt3*It is\qt3; others said, \qt3*No, but it is like him.\qt3 He said, \qt3*I am the man.\qt3 
\v 10  So they asked him, \qt3*How were your eyes opened?\qt3 
\v 11  He replied, \qt3*The man they call Jesus made some clay and smeared my eyes with it and told me, \qt2*Go and wash them in Siloam\qt2; so I went and washed them, and I got my sight.\qt3 
\v 12  \qt3*Where is he?\qt3 they asked; he answered, \qt3*I do not know.\qt3 
\v 13  They brought him before the Pharisees, this man who had once been blind. 
\v 14  Now it was on the sabbath day that Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes. 
\v 15  So the Pharisees asked him again how he had regained his sight, and he told them, \qt3*He smeared some clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and now I can see.\qt3 
\v 16  Then said some of the Pharisees, \qt3*This man is not from God, for he does not keep the sabbath\qt3; others said, \qt3*How can a sinner perform such Signs?\qt3 They were divided on this. 
\v 17  So they asked the blind man once more, \qt3*What have you to say about him, for opening your eyes?\qt3 The man replied, \qt3*I say he is a prophet.\qt3 
\v 18  Now the Jews would not believe he had been born blind and had regained his sight, till they summoned the parents of the man who had regained his sight 
\v 19  and asked them, \qt3*Is this your son, the son you declare was born blind? How is it that he can see now?\qt3 
\v 20  His parents answered, \qt3*This is our son, and he was born blind; we know that. 
\v 21  But how he can see to-day, we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask himself; he is of age, he can speak for himself.\qt3 
\v 22  (His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that anyone who confessed him to be Christ should be excommunicated. 
\v 23  That was why the man's parents said, \qt3*He is of age, ask himself.\qt3) 
\v 24  So the man born blind was summoned a second time, and told, \qt3*Now give God the praise; this man, we know quite well, is only a sinner.\qt3 
\v 25  To which he replied, \qt3*I do not know whether he is a sinner; one thing I do know, that once I was blind and now I can see.\qt3 
\v 26  \qt3*What did he do to you?\qt3 they repeated; \qt3*How did he open your eyes?\qt3 
\v 27  He retorted, \qt3*I have told you that already, and you would not listen to me. Why do you want to hear it over again? Do you want to be disciples of his?\qt3 
\v 28  Then they stormed at him: \qt3*You are his disciple, we are disciples of Moses! 
\v 29  We know God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this fellow comes from.\qt3 
\v 30  The man replied to them, \qt3*Well, this is astonishing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he has opened my eyes! 
\v 31  God, we know, does not listen to sinners; he listens to anyone who is devout and who obeys his will. 
\v 32  It is unheard of, since the world began, that anyone should open a blind man's eyes. 
\v 33  If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\qt3 
\v 34  They retorted, \qt3*And so you would teach us — you, born in utter depravity!\qt3 Then they expelled him. 
\v 35  Jesus heard that they had expelled him, and on meeting him he said, \qt3*You believe in the Son of man?\qt3 
\v 36  \qt3*Who is that, sir?\qt3 said the man, \qt3*tell me, that I may believe in him.\qt3 
\v 37  \qt3*You have seen him,\qt3 Jesus said, \qt3*he is talking to you.\qt3 
\v 38  He said, \qt3*I do believe, Lord\qt3 — and he worshipped him. 
\v 39  Then said Jesus, \qt3*It is for judgment that I have come into this world, to make the sightless see, to make the seeing blind.\qt3 
\v 40  On hearing this the Pharisees who were beside him asked, \qt3*And are we blind?\qt3 
\v 41  Jesus replied, \qt3*If you were blind, you would not be guilty; but, as it is, you claim to have sight — and so your sin remains.\qt3 
\c 10
\v 1  Truly, truly I tell you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs up somewhere else, he is a thief and a robber; 
\v 2  he who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. 
\v 3  The gate-keeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice; he calls his sheep by name and leads them out. 
\v 4  When he has brought all his sheep outside, he goes in front of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice; 
\v 5  they will not follow a stranger, they will run from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.\qt3* 
\v 6  Jesus told them this allegory, but they did not understand what he was saying to them; 
\v 7  so he said to them again, \qt3Truly, truly I tell you, I am the shepherd of the sheep; 
\v 8  all who ever came before me have been thieves and robbers — but the sheep would not listen to them. 
\v 9  (I am the Gate; whoever enters by me will be saved, he will go in and out and find pasture.) 
\v 10  The thief only comes to steal, to slay, and to destroy: I have come that they may have life and have it to the full. 
\v 11  I am the good shepherd; a good shepherd lays down his own life for the sheep. 
\v 12  The hired man, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, deserts them when he sees the wolf coming; he runs away, leaving the wolf to tear and scatter them, 
\v 13  just because he is a hired man, who has no interest in the sheep. 
\v 14  I am the good shepherd, I know my sheep and my sheep know me 
\v 15  (just as the Father knows me and I know the Father,) and I lay down my life for the sheep. 
\v 16  I have other sheep, too, which do not belong to this fold; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice; so it will be one flock, one shepherd. 
\v 17  This is why my Father loves me, because I lay down my life to take it up again. 
\v 18  No one takes it from me, I lay it down of my own accord: I have power to lay it down and also power to take it up again; I have my Father's orders for this. 
\v 19  The Jews were again divided over these words. 
\v 20  A number of them said, \qt3*He is mad. Why listen to him?\qt3 
\v 21  Others said, \qt3*These are not a madman's words. Can a madman open the eyes of the blind?\qt3 
\v 22  [vss 22-29 moved to follow 9:41] Then came the festival of Dedication at Jerusalem; it was winter, 
\v 23  and Jesus used to walk inside the temple, in the portico of Solomon. 
\v 24  So the Jews gathered round him and asked, \qt3*How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.\qt3 
\v 25  Jesus replied, \qt3*I have told you, but you do not believe; the deeds I do in the name of my Father testify to me, but you do not believe, 
\v 26  because you do not belong to my sheep. 
\v 27  My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them and they follow me; 
\v 28  and I give them eternal life; they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. 
\v 29  My Father who gave me them is stronger than all, and no one can snatch anything out of the Father's hand. 
\v 30  I and my Father are one — .\qt3 
\v 31  The Jews again caught up stones to stone him. 
\v 32  Jesus replied, \qt3*I have let you see many a good deed of God; for which of them do you mean to stone me?\qt3 
\v 33  The Jews retorted, \qt3*We mean to stone you, not for a good deed, but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, make yourself God.\qt3 
\v 34  Jesus answered, \qt3*Is it not written in your Law, \qt2*I said, you are gods\qt2? 
\v 35  If the Law said they were gods, to whom the word of God came — and scripture cannot be broken — 
\v 36  do you mean to tell me, whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, \qt2*You are blaspheming,\qt2 because I said, \qt2*I am God's Son\qt2? 
\v 37  If I am not doing the deeds of my Father, do not believe me; 
\v 38  but if I am, then believe the deeds, though you will not believe me — that you may learn and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.\qt3 
\v 39  Once more they tried to arrest him, but he escaped their hands 
\v 40  and went across the Jordan, back to the spot where John had baptized at first. There he stayed; 
\v 41  and many came to him, saying, \qt3*John did not perform any Sign, but all he ever said about this man was true.\qt3 
\v 42  And many believed in him there. 
\c 11
\v 1  Now there was a man ill, Lazarus of Bethany — the village of Mary and her sister Martha. 
\v 2  (The Mary whose brother Lazarus was ill was the Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair.) 
\v 3  so the sisters sent to him, saying, \qt3*Lord, he whom you love is ill.\qt3 
\v 4  When Jesus heard it, he said, \qt3*This illness is not to end in death; the end of it is the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.\qt3 
\v 5  [Relocated to follow vs 2] Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus; 
\v 6  So, when he heard of the illness, he stayed where he was for two days; then, 
\v 7  after that, he said to the disciples, \qt3*Let us go back to Judaea.\qt3 
\v 8  \qt3*Rabbi,\qt3 said the disciples, \qt3*the Jews were trying to stone you only the other day; are you going back there?\qt3 
\v 9  Jesus replied, \qt3*Are there not twelve hours in the day? If one walks during the day he does not stumble, for he sees the light of this world: 
\v 10  but if one walks during the night he does stumble, for the light is not in him.\qt3 
\v 11  This he said, then added, \qt3*Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; I am going to waken him.\qt3 
\v 12  \qt3*Lord,\qt3 said the disciples, \qt3*if he has fallen asleep, he will get better.\qt3 
\v 13  Jesus, however, had been speaking of his death; but as they imagined he meant natural sleep, 
\v 14  he then told them plainly, \qt3*Lazarus is dead; 
\v 15  and for your sakes I am glad I was not there, that you may believe. Come now, let us go to him.\qt3 
\v 16  Whereupon Thomas (called \qt4the Twin\qt4*) said to his fellow-disciples, \qt3*Let us go too, let us die along with him!\qt3 
\v 17  Now when Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been buried for four days. 
\v 18  [vss 18 &amp; 19 placed between vss 30 &amp; 31] Now as Bethany is not far from Jerusalem, only about two miles away, 
\v 19  a number of Jews had gone to condole with Martha and Mary about their brother; 
\v 20  Then Martha, hearing of the arrival of Jesus, went out to meet him, while Mary sat at home. 
\v 21  Said Martha to Jesus, \qt3*Had you been here, Lord, my brother would not have died. 
\v 22  But now — well, I know whatever you ask God for, he will grant you.\qt3 
\v 23  Jesus said to her, \qt3*Your brother will rise again.\qt3 
\v 24  \qt3*I know,\qt3 said Martha, \qt3*he will rise at the resurrection, on the last day.\qt3 
\v 25  Jesus said to her, \qt3*I am myself resurrection and life: he who believes in me will live, even if he dies, 
\v 26  and no one who lives and believes in me will ever die. You believe that?\qt3 
\v 27  \qt3*Yes, Lord,\qt3 she said, \qt3*I do believe you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world\qt3 — 
\v 28  and with these words she went off to call her sister Mary, telling her secretly, \qt3*The Teacher is here, and he is calling for you.\qt3 
\v 29  So, on hearing this, Mary rose hurriedly and went to him. 
\v 30  Jesus had not entered the village yet, he was still at the spot where Martha had met him. 
\v 31  and when the Jews who were condoling with her inside the house noticed her rise hurriedly and go out, they followed her, as they imagined she was going to wail at the tomb. 
\v 32  But when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she dropped at his feet, crying, \qt3*Had you been here, Lord, my brother would not have died.\qt3 
\v 33  Now when Jesus saw her wailing and saw the Jews who accompanied her wailing, he chafed in spirit and was disquieted. 
\v 34  \qt3*Where have you laid him?\qt3 he asked. They answered, \qt3*Come and see, sir.\qt3 
\v 35  Jesus burst into tears. 
\v 36  Whereupon the Jews said, \qt3*See how he loved him!\qt3 — 
\v 37  though some of them asked, \qt3*Could he not have prevented him from dying, when he could open a blind man's eyes?\qt3 
\v 38  This made Jesus chafe afresh, so he went to the tomb; it was a cave with a boulder to close it. 
\v 39  Jesus said, \qt3*Remove the boulder.\qt3 \qt3*Lord,\qt3 said Martha, the dead man's sister, \qt3*he will be stinking by this time; he has been dead four days.\qt3 
\v 40  \qt3*Did I not tell you,\qt3 said Jesus, \qt3*if you will only believe, you shall see the glory of God?\qt3 
\v 41  Then they removed the boulder, and Jesus, lifting his eyes to heaven, said, \qt3*Father, I thank thee for listening to me. 
\v 42  (I knew thou wouldst always listen to me, but I spoke on account of the crowd around, that they might believe thou hast sent me.)\qt3 
\v 43  So saying, he exclaimed with a loud cry, \qt3*Lazarus, come out!\qt3 
\v 44  Out came the dead man, his feet and hands swathed in bandages, and his face tied up with a towel. Jesus said, \qt3*Untie him, and let him move.\qt3 
\v 45  Now a number of the Jews who had come to visit Mary and who witnessed what he had done, believed in him. 
\v 46  But some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done; 
\v 47  whereupon the high priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. \qt3*Whatever is to be done?\qt3 they said. \qt3*The fellow is performing a number of Signs. 
\v 48  If we let him alone, like this, everybody will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and suppress our holy Place and our nation.\qt3 
\v 49  But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said, \qt3*You know nothing about it — 
\v 50  you do not understand it is in your own interests that one man should die for the People, instead of the whole nation being destroyed.\qt3 
\v 51  (He did not say this simply of his own accord; he was high priest that year, and his words were a prophecy that Jesus was to die for the nation, 
\v 52  and not merely for the nation but to gather into one the scattered children of God.) 
\v 53  So from that day their plan was to kill him. 
\v 54  Accordingly Jesus no longer appeared in public among the Jews, but withdrew to the country adjoining the desert, to a town called Ephraim; there he stayed with the disciples. 
\v 55  Now the passover of the Jews was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem, to purify themselves before the passover. 
\v 56  They looked out for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple they said to one another, \qt3*What do you think? Do you think he will not come up to the festival?\qt3 
\v 57  (The high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that they were to be informed, if anyone found out where he was, so that they might arrest him.) 
\c 12
\v 1  Six days before the festival, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus stayed (whom Jesus had raised from the dead). 
\v 2  They gave a supper for him there; Martha waited on him, and Lazarus was among those who reclined at table beside him. 
\v 3  Then Mary, taking a pound of expensive perfume, real nard, anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair, till the house was filled with the scent of the perfume. 
\v 4  One of his disciples, Judas Iscariot (who was to betray him), said, 
\v 5  \qt3*Why was not this perfume sold for ten pounds, and the money given to the poor?\qt3 
\v 6  (Not that he cared for the poor; he said this because he was a thief, and because he carried the money-box and pilfered what was put in.) 
\v 7  Then said Jesus, \qt3*Let her alone, let her keep what she has for the day of my burial. 
\v 8  You have always the poor beside you, but you have not always me.\qt3 
\v 9  Now the great mass of the Jews learned he was there, and they came not only on account of Jesus but to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead. 
\v 10  So the high priests planned to kill Lazarus as well, 
\v 11  since it was owing to him that a number of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus. 
\v 12  Next day the great mass of people who had come up for the festival heard that Jesus was entering Jerusalem, 
\v 13  and taking palm-branches they went out to meet him, shouting, \qt3*Hosanna! Blessed be he who comes in the Lord's name, the king of Israel!\qt3 
\v 14  And Jesus came across a young ass and seated himself on it; as it is written, 
\v 15  Fear not, daughter of Sion; here is your king coming, seated on an ass's colt. 
\v 16  (His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered this had been written of him and had happened to him.) 
\v 17  Now the people who were with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead, testified to it; 
\v 18  and that was why the crowd went out to meet him, because they heard he had performed this Sign. 
\v 19  Then said the Pharisees to one another, \qt3*You see, you can do nothing! Look, the world has gone after him.\qt3 
\v 20  Now there were some Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the festival; 
\v 21  they came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee and appealed to him, saying, \qt3*Sir, we want to see Jesus.\qt3 
\v 22  Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. 
\v 23  And Jesus answered, \qt3*The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. 
\v 24  Truly, truly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains a single grain; but if it dies, it bears rich fruit. 
\v 25  He who loves his life loses it, and he who cares not for his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life. 
\v 26  If anyone serves me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall my servant be also: if anyone serves me, my Father will honour him. 
\v 27  My soul is now disquieted. What am I to say? \qt2*Father, save me from this hour\qt2? Nay, it is something else that has brought me to this hour: 
\v 28  I will say, \qt2*Father, glorify thy name.\qt2\qt3 Then came a voice from heaven, \qt3*I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.\qt3 
\v 29  When they heard the sound, the people standing by said it had thundered; others said, \qt3*An angel spoke to him.\qt3 
\v 30  Jesus answered, \qt3*This voice did not come for my sake but for yours. 
\v 31  Now is this world to be judged; now the Prince of this world will be expelled. 
\v 32  But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.\qt3 
\v 33  (By this he indicated the kind of death he was to die.) 
\v 34  So the people answered, \qt3*We have learned from the Law that the Christ is to remain for ever; what do you mean by saying that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?\qt3 
\v 35  Then Jesus said to them, \qt3*The Light will shine among you for a little longer yet; walk while you have the Light, that the darkness may not overtake you. He who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. 
\v 36  While you have the Light, believe in the Light, that you may be sons of the Light.\qt3 [vss 36b to 43 are relocated after vs 50] With these words Jesus went away and hid from them. 
\v 37  Now for all the Signs he had performed before them, they did not believe in him — 
\v 38  that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: Lord, who has believed what they heard from us, And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
\v 39  This was why they could not believe; for Isaiah again said, 
\v 40  He has blinded their eyes and made their hearts insensible, to prevent them seeing with their eyes and understanding with their hearts and turning for me to cure them. 
\v 41  (Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.) 
\v 42  Still, a number even of the authorities believed in him, though they would not confess it on account of the Pharisees, in case of being excommunicated; 
\v 43  they preferred the approval of men to the approval of God. 
\v 44  And Jesus cried aloud, \qt3*He who believes in me believes not in me but in him who sent me, 
\v 45  and he who beholds me beholds him who sent me. 
\v 46  I have come as light into the world, that no one who believes in me may remain in the dark. 
\v 47  If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, it is not I who judge him; for I have not come to judge the world but to save the world. 
\v 48  He who rejects me and will not receive my words has indeed a judge: the word I have spoken will judge him on the last day, 
\v 49  for I have not spoken of my own accord — the Father who sent me, he it was who ordered me what to say and what to speak. 
\v 50  And I know his orders mean eternal life. Therefore when I speak, I speak as the Father has told me.\qt3 
\c 13
\v 1  Now before the passover festival Jesus knew the time had come for him to pass from this world to the Father. He had loved his own in this world and he loved them to the end; 
\v 2  so at supper, knowing that though the devil had suggested to Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him, 
\v 3  the Father had put everything into his hands — knowing that he had come from God and was going to God, 
\v 4  he rose from table, laid aside his robe, and tied a towel round him, 
\v 5  then poured water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, wiping them with the towel he had tied round him. 
\v 6  He came to Simon Peter. \qt3*Lord,\qt3 said he, \qt3*you to wash my feet!\qt3 
\v 7  Jesus answered him, \qt3*You do not understand just now what I am doing, but you will understand it later on.\qt3 
\v 8  Said Peter, \qt3*You will never wash my feet, never!\qt3 \qt3*Unless I wash you,\qt3 Jesus replied, \qt3*you will not share my lot.\qt3 
\v 9  \qt3*Lord,\qt3 said Simon Peter, \qt3*then wash not only my feet but my hands and head.\qt3 
\v 10  Jesus said, \qt3*He who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed; he is clean all over. And you are clean — but not all of you\qt3 
\v 11  (he knew the traitor; that was why he said, \qt3*You are not all clean\qt3). 
\v 12  Then, after washing their feet and putting on his robe, he lay down again. \qt3*Do you know,\qt3 he said to them, \qt3*what I have been doing to you? 
\v 13  You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right: that is what I am. 
\v 14  Well, if I have washed your feet, I who am your Lord and Teacher, you are bound to wash one another's feet; 
\v 15  for I have been setting you an example, that you should do what I have done to you. 
\v 16  Truly, truly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than he who sent him. 
\v 17  If you know all this, blessed are you if you really do it. 
\v 18  When I say \qt2*you,\qt2 I do not mean you all; I know the men of my choice, and I made my choice that this scripture might be fulfilled, he who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me. 
\v 19  I am telling you this now, before it occurs, so that when it has occurred you may believe who I am. 
\v 20  (Truly, truly I tell you, he who receives anyone I send receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.)\qt3 
\v 21  On saying this, Jesus was disquieted in spirit: he testified and said, \qt3*Truly, truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.\qt3 
\v 22  The disciples looked at each other, at a loss to know which of them he meant. 
\v 23  As one of his disciples was reclining on his breast — he was the favourite of Jesus — 
\v 24  Peter nodded to him, saying, \qt3*Tell us who he means.\qt3 
\v 25  The disciple just leant back on the breast of Jesus and said, \qt3*Lord, who is it?\qt3 
\v 26  Jesus answered, \qt3*The man I am going to give this piece of bread to, when I dip it in the dish.\qt3 Then he took the piece of bread, dipped it, and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot; 
\v 27  and when he took the bread, at that moment Satan entered him. Then Jesus told him, \qt3*Be quick with what you have to do.\qt3 
\v 28  (None of those at table understood why he said this to him; 
\v 29  some of them thought that as Judas kept the money-box, Jesus told him to buy what they needed for the festival or to give something to the poor.) 
\v 30  So Judas went out immediately after taking the bread. And it was night. 
\v 31  When he had gone out, Jesus said, Now at last the Son of man is glorified, and in him God is glorified: [if God is glorified in him,] 
\v 32  God will glorify him in Himself and glorify him at once. 
\v 33  My dear children, I am only to be with you a little longer; then you will look for me, and, as I told the Jews I tell you now, where I go you cannot come. 
\v 34  I give you a new command, to love one another — as I have loved you, you are to love one another. 
\v 35  By this everyone will recognize that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.\qt3* 
\v 36  \qt3Lord,\qt3* said Simon Peter, \qt3where are you going?\qt3* Jesus replied, \qt3I am going where you cannot follow me at present; later on you will follow me.\qt3* 
\v 37  \qt3Lord,\qt3* said Peter, \qt3why cannot I follow you just now? I will lay down my life for you.\qt3* 
\v 38  Jesus replied, \qt3Lay down your life for me? Truly, truly I tell you, before the cock crows, you will have disowned me thrice over. 
\c 14
\v 1  Let not your hearts be disquieted; you believe — believe in God and also in me. 
\v 2  In my Father's house there are many abodes; were it not so, would I have told you that I was going to prepare a place for you? 
\v 3  And when I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me, so that you may be where I am. 
\v 4  And you know the way to where I am going.\qt3* 
\v 5  \qt3Lord,\qt3* said Thomas, \qt3we do not know where you are going, and how are we to know the way?\qt3* 
\v 6  Jesus said to him, \qt3I am the real and living way: no one comes to the Father except by means of me. 
\v 7  If you knew me, you would know my Father too. You know him now and you have seen him.\qt3* 
\v 8  \qt3Lord,\qt3* said Philip, \qt3let us see the Father; that is all we want.\qt3* 
\v 9  Jesus said to him, \qt3Philip, have I been with you all this time, and yet you do not understand me? He who has seen me has seen the Father. What do you mean by saying, \qt4Let us see the Father\qt4*? 
\v 10  Do you not believe I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak to you all I do not speak of my own accord; it is the Father who remains ever in me, who is performing his own deeds. 
\v 11  Believe me, I am in the Father and the Father is in me: — or else, believe because of the deeds themselves. 
\v 12  Truly, truly I tell you, he who believes in me will do the very deeds I do, and still greater deeds than these. For I am going to the Father, 
\v 13  and I will do whatever you ask in my name, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; 
\v 14  I will do whatever you ask me in my name. 
\v 15  If you love me you will keep my commands, 
\v 16  and I will ask the Father to give you another Helper to be with you for ever, 
\v 17  even the Spirit of truth: the world cannot receive him, because it neither sees nor knows him, but you know him, because he remains with you and will be within you. 
\v 18  I will not leave you forlorn; I am coming to you. 
\v 19  A little while longer and the world will see me no more; but you will see me, because I am living and you will be living too. 
\v 20  You will understand, on that day, that I am in my Father and you are in me and I am in you. 
\v 21  He who possesses my commands and obeys them is he who loves me, and he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and appear to him.\qt3* 
\v 22  \qt3Lord,\qt3* said Judas (not Judas Iscariot), \qt3why is it that you are to appear to us, and not to the world?\qt3* 
\v 23  Jesus answered, \qt3If anyone loves me he will obey my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and take up our abode with him. 
\v 24  He who does not love me does not obey my word; and what you hear me say is not my word but the word of the Father who sent me. 
\v 25  I have told you all this while I am still with you, 
\v 26  but the Helper, the holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything and recall to you everything I have said. 
\v 27  Peace I leave to you, my peace I give to you; I give it not as the world gives its \qt4Peace!\qt4* Let not your hearts be disquieted or timid. 
\v 28  You heard me tell you I was going away and coming back to you; if you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father — for the Father is greater than I am. 
\v 29  I tell you this now, before it occurs, so that, when it does occur, you may believe. 
\v 30  I will no longer talk much with you, for the Prince of this world is coming. He has no hold on me; 
\v 31  his coming will only serve to let the world see that I love the Father and that I am acting as the Father ordered. Rise, let us be going.\qt3* 
\c 15
\v 1  [Chapters 15 &amp; 16 are placed in the middle of verse 13:31] \qt3I am the real Vine, and my Father is the vine-dresser; 
\v 2  he cuts away any branch on me which is not bearing fruit, and cleans every branch which does bear fruit, to make it bear richer fruit. 
\v 3  You are already clean, by the word I have spoken to you. 
\v 4  Remain in me, as I remain in you: just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself, without remaining on the vine, neither can you, unless you remain in me. 
\v 5  I am the vine, you are the branches. He who remains in me, as I in him, bears rich fruit (because apart from me you can do nothing). 
\v 6  If anyone does not remain in me he is thrown aside like a branch and he withers up; then the branches are gathered and thrown into the fire to be burned. 
\v 7  If you remain in me and my words remain in you, then ask whatever you like and you shall have it. 
\v 8  As you bear rich fruit and prove yourselves my disciples, my Father is glorified. 
\v 9  As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; remain within my love. 
\v 10  If you keep my commands you will remain within my love, just as I have kept my Father's commands and remain within his love. 
\v 11  I have told you this, that my joy may be within you and your joy complete. 
\v 12  This is my command: you are to love one another as I have loved you. 
\v 13  To lay life down for his friends, man has no greater love than that. 
\v 14  You are my friends — if you do what I command you; 
\v 15  I call you servants no longer, because a servant does not know what his master is doing: I call you friends, because I have imparted to you all that I have learned from my Father. 
\v 16  You have not chosen me, it is I who have chosen you, appointing you to go and bear fruit — fruit that lasts, so that the Father may grant you whatever you ask in my name. 
\v 17  This is what I command you, to love one another. 
\v 18  If the world hates you, remember it hated me first. 
\v 19  If you belonged to the world, the world would love what it owned; it is because you do not belong to the world, because I have chosen you from the world, that the world hates you. 
\v 20  Remember what I told you, \qt4A servant is not greater than his master.\qt4* If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they hold to my word, they will hold to yours. 
\v 21  They will do all this to you on account of my name, because they know not him who sent me. 
\v 22  They would not be guilty, if I had not come and spoken to them; but, as it is, they have no excuse for their sin — 
\v 23  he who hates me hates my Father also. 
\v 24  They would not be guilty, if I had not done deeds among them such as no one has ever done; but, as it is, they have seen — and they have hated — both me and my Father. 
\v 25  It is that the word written in their Law may be fulfilled: they hated me for no cause. 
\v 26  When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth which issues from the Father, he will bear witness to me; 
\v 27  and you too are witnesses, for you have been with me from the very beginning. 
\c 16
\v 1  I have told you all this, to keep you from being repelled. 
\v 2  They will excommunicate you; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will imagine he is performing a service to God. 
\v 3  This they will do to you, because they have not known the Father nor me. 
\v 4  I have told you all this, so that when the time for it arrives, you may remember what I said to you. I did not tell you about this at the beginning, because I was with you then; 
\v 5  but now I am going to him who sent me. And yet not one of you asks, \qt4Where are you going?\qt4* 
\v 6  No, your heart is full of sorrow at what I have told you. 
\v 7  Yet — I am telling you the truth — my going is for your good. If I do not depart, the Helper will not come to you; whereas if I go, I will send him to you. 
\v 8  And when he comes, he will convict the world, convincing men of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment: 
\v 9  of sin, because they do not believe in me; 
\v 10  of righteousness, because I go to the Father and you see me no more; 
\v 11  of judgment, because the Prince of this world has been judged. 
\v 12  I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it just now. 
\v 13  However, when the Spirit of truth comes, he will lead you into all the truth; for he will not speak of his own accord, he will say whatever he is told, and he will disclose to you what is to come. 
\v 14  He will glorify me, for he will draw upon what is mine and disclose it to you. 
\v 15  All that the Father has is mine; that is why I say, \qt4he will draw upon what is mine and disclose it to you.\qt4* 
\v 16  In a little while, you will behold me no longer; then, after a little, you shall see me.\qt3* 
\v 17  So some of his disciples said to one another, \qt3What does he mean by telling us, \qt4In a little while, you will behold me no longer; then, after a little, you shall see me\qt4*? and, \qt4I go to the Father\qt4*?\qt3* 
\v 18  They said, \qt3What is the meaning of \qt4In a little\qt4*? We do not understand what he is saying.\qt3* 
\v 19  Jesus knew they wanted to ask him; so he said to them, \qt3Is this what you are discussing together, why I said, \qt4In a little while, you will not see me: then, after a little, you shall see me\qt4*? 
\v 20  Truly, truly I tell you, you will be wailing and lamenting while the world is rejoicing; you will be sorrowful, but then your sorrow will be changed into joy. 
\v 21  When a woman is in labour she is sorry, for her time has come; but when the child is born she remembers her anguish no longer, for joy that a human being has been born into the world: 
\v 22  So with you. Just now you are in sorrow, but I shall see you again and your heart will rejoice — with a joy that no one can take from you. 
\v 23  And on that day you will not ask me any questions. Truly, truly I tell you, whatever you ask the Father, he will give you in my name; 
\v 24  hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask and you will receive, that your joy may be full. 
\v 25  I have told you this in figures, but the time is coming when I shall speak to you in figures no longer; I shall let you know plainly about the Father. 
\v 26  On that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you I will ask the Father on your behalf; 
\v 27  for the Father loves you himself, because you have loved me and believed that I came forth from God. 
\v 28  From the Father I came and I entered the world; again, I leave the world and I go to the Father.\qt3* 
\v 29  His disciples said, \qt3Now, you are talking plainly at last, not speaking in figures. 
\v 30  Now we are sure you know everything, and need no one to put questions to you. This makes us believe you have come forth from God.\qt3* 
\v 31  Jesus replied, \qt3You believe it, at last? 
\v 32  Behold, the time is coming, it has come already, when you will be scattered to your homes, everyone of you, leaving me alone. But I am not alone, for the Father is with me. 
\v 33  I have said all this to you that in me you may have peace; in the world you have trouble, but courage! I have conquered the world. 
\c 17
\v 1  So Jesus spoke; then, lifting his eyes to heaven, he said: \qt3*Father, the time has now come; glorify thy Son that thy Son may glorify thee, 
\v 2  since thou hast granted him power over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom thou hast given to him. 
\v 3  And this is eternal life, that they know thee, the only real God, and him whom thou hast sent, even Jesus Christ. 
\v 4  I have glorified thee on earth by accomplishing the work thou gavest me to do; 
\v 5  now, Father, glorify me in thy presence with the glory which I enjoyed in thy presence before the world began. 
\v 6  I have made thy Name known to the men whom thou hast given to me from the world (thine they were, and thou gavest them to me), and they have held to thy word. 
\v 7  They know now that whatever thou hast given me comes from thee, 
\v 8  for I have given them the words thou gavest me, and they have received them; they are now sure that I came from thee and believe that thou didst send me. 
\v 9  I pray for them — not for the world but for those whom thou hast given me do I pray; for they are thine 
\v 10  (all mine is thine and thine is mine), and I am glorified in them. 
\v 11  I am to be in the world no longer, but they are to be in the world; I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them by the power of thy Name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are one. 
\v 12  When I was with them, I kept them by the power of thy Name which thou hast given me; I guarded them, and not one of them perished — only the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled. 
\v 13  But now I come to thee (I speak thus in the world that they may have my joy complete within them). 
\v 14  I have given them thy word, and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. 
\v 15  I pray not that thou wilt take them out of the world, but that thou wilt keep them from the evil one. 
\v 16  They do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. 
\v 17  Consecrate them by thy truth: thy word is truth. 
\v 18  As thou hast sent me into the world, so have I sent them into the world, 
\v 19  and for their sake I consecrate myself that they may be consecrated by the truth. 
\v 20  Nor do I pray for them alone, but for all who believe in me by their spoken word; 
\v 21  may they all be one! As thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, so may they be in us — that the world may believe thou hast sent me. 
\v 22  Yea, I have given them the glory thou gavest me, that they may be one as we are one — 
\v 23  I in them and thou in me — that they may be made perfectly one, so that the world may recognize that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me. 
\v 24  Father, it is my will that these, thy gift to me, may be beside me where I am, to behold my glory which thou hast given me, because thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. 
\v 25  O just Father, though the world has not known thee, I have known thee, and they have known that thou hast sent me; 
\v 26  so have I declared, so will I declare, thy Name to them, that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.\qt3 
\c 18
\v 1  Having said this, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron ravine to an orchard, which he entered in the company of his disciples. 
\v 2  Judas the traitor also knew the spot, for Jesus and his disciples often met there. 
\v 3  So after procuring troops and some attendants belonging to the high priests and the Pharisees, Judas went there with lanterns and torches and weapons. 
\v 4  Then Jesus, who knew everything that was to happen to him, came forward and asked them, \qt3*Who are you looking for?\qt3 
\v 5  \qt3*Jesus the Nazarene,\qt3 they replied. Jesus said, \qt3*I am he.\qt3 (And Judas the traitor was standing beside them.) 
\v 6  When he said, \qt3*I am he,\qt3 they fell back and dropped to the ground; 
\v 7  so he asked them once more, \qt3*Who are you looking for?\qt3 And when they replied, \qt3*Jesus the Nazarene,\qt3 
\v 8  he answered, \qt3*I told you that I am he; if it is me you are looking for, let these men get away\qt3 
\v 9  (this was to fulfil his own word: \qt4I did not lose a single one of those whom thou didst give me\qt4*). 
\v 10  Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear (the servant's name was Malchus); 
\v 11  whereupon Jesus said to Peter, \qt3*Sheathe your sword. Am I not to drink the cup which the Father has handed me?\qt3 
\v 12  So the troops and their commander and the Jewish attendants seized Jesus, bound him, 
\v 13  and brought him first of all to Annas (for Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year — 
\v 14  the Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was for their interests that one man should die for the people). 
\v 15  [vss 15-18 moved to between 24 &amp; 25] Simon Peter followed Jesus along with another disciple; and as this disciple was an acquaintance of the high priest, he passed into the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus, 
\v 16  while Peter stood outside at the door. Then this other disciple, who was an acquaintance of the high priest, came out and spoke to the woman at the door, and brought Peter inside. 
\v 17  The maidservant at the door then said to Peter, \qt3*Are you not one of this fellow's disciples?\qt3 He said, \qt3*No.\qt3 
\v 18  Now the servants and the attendants were standing and warming themselves at a charcoal fire which they had lit (for it was cold), and Peter also stood beside them and warmed himself. 
\v 19  Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. 
\v 20  Jesus answered, \qt3*I have spoken openly to the world; I have always taught in the synagogues and in the temple, where all Jews gather; I have said nothing in secret. 
\v 21  Why ask me? Ask my hearers what I have said to them; they know what I said.\qt3 
\v 22  As he said this, one of the attendants who stood by gave him a blow, saying, \qt3*Is that how you answer the high priest?\qt3 
\v 23  \qt3*If I have said anything wrong,\qt3 replied Jesus, \qt3*prove it; if I said what was true, why strike me?\qt3 
\v 24  Then Annas had him bound and sent him to Caiaphas the high priest. 
\v 25  They asked him, \qt3*Are you not one of his disciples?\qt3 He denied it, saying, \qt3*No,\qt3 
\v 26  Said one of the high priest's servants, a kinsman of the man whose ear had been cut off by Peter, \qt3*Did I not see you with him in the orchard?\qt3 
\v 27  Again Peter denied it. And at that very moment the cock crowed. 
\v 28  Then from the house of Caiaphas they took Jesus to the praetorium. (It was early morning.) They would not enter the praetorium themselves, in case of being ceremonially defiled, for they wanted to eat the passover; 
\v 29  so Pilate came outside to them and asked, \qt3*What charge do you bring against this man?\qt3 
\v 30  They retorted, \qt3*If he had not been a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.\qt3 
\v 31  Then said Pilate, \qt3*Take him yourselves, and sentence him according to your own Law.\qt3 The Jews said, \qt3*We have no right to put anyone to death\qt3 
\v 32  (that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, by which he had indicated the kind of death he was to die). 
\v 33  So Pilate went back inside the praetorium and called Jesus, saying, \qt3*Then you are king of the Jews?\qt3 
\v 34  Jesus replied, \qt3*Are you saying this of your own accord, or did other people tell you about me?\qt3 
\v 35  \qt3*Am I a Jew?\qt3 said Pilate. \qt3*Your own nation and the high priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?\qt3 
\v 36  Jesus replied, \qt3*My realm does not belong to this world; if my realm did belong to this world, my men would have fought to prevent me being handed over to the Jews. No, my realm lies elsewhere.\qt3 
\v 37  \qt3*So you are a king?\qt3 said Pilate, \qt3*you!\qt3 \qt3*Certainly,\qt3 said Jesus, \qt3*I am a king. This is why I was born, this is why I came into the world, to bear testimony to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\qt3 
\v 38  \qt3*Truth!\qt3 said Pilate, \qt3*what is truth!\qt3 With these words he went outside to the Jews again and told them, \qt3*I cannot find anything wrong about him. 
\v 39  But it is your custom that I should release a prisoner for you at the passover. Is it your will that I release you the king of the Jews?\qt3 
\v 40  Again they yelled, \qt3*No, not him! Bar-Abbas!\qt3 Now Bar-Abbas was a robber. 
\c 19
\v 1  Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged. 
\v 2  And the soldiers twisted some thorns into a crown and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple robe, 
\v 3  marching up to him and shouting, \qt3*Hail, king of the Jews!\qt3 — and striking him. 
\v 4  Again Pilate went out and said to them, \qt3*Look, I am bringing him out to you. Understand, I cannot find anything wrong about him.\qt3 
\v 5  So out came Jesus, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said, \qt3*Here the man is!\qt3 
\v 6  Now when the high priests and their attendants saw him, they yelled, \qt3*Crucify him, crucify him!\qt3 Pilate said, \qt3*Take him and crucify him yourselves! I find nothing wrong about him.\qt3 
\v 7  The Jews retorted, \qt3*But we have a Law, and by [our] Law he is bound to die, because he has made himself out to be God's Son.\qt3 
\v 8  Now when Pilate heard that, he was still more afraid; 
\v 9  he went inside the praetorium again and asked Jesus, \qt3*Where do you come from?\qt3 Jesus made no reply. 
\v 10  Then Pilate said, \qt3*You will not speak to me? Do you not know it is in my power to release you or to crucify you?\qt3 
\v 11  Jesus answered, \qt3*You would have no power over me, unless it had been granted you from above. So you are less guilty than he who betrayed me to you.\qt3 
\v 12  This made Pilate anxious to release him, but the Jews yelled, \qt3*If you release him, you are no friend of Caesar's! Anyone who makes himself a king is against Caesar!\qt3 
\v 13  On hearing this, Pilate brought Jesus out and seated him on the tribunal at a spot called the \qt4mosaic pavement\qt4* — the Hebrew name is Gabbatha 
\v 14  (it was the day of Preparation for the passover, about noon). \qt3*There is your king!\qt3 he said to the Jews. 
\v 15  Then they yelled, \qt3*Off with him! Off with him! Crucify him!\qt3 \qt3*Crucify your king?\qt3 said Pilate. The high priests retorted, \qt3*We have no king but Caesar!\qt3 
\v 16  Then Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus, 
\v 17  and he went away, carrying the cross by himself, to the spot called the \qt4place of the skull\qt4* — the Hebrew name is Golgotha; 
\v 18  there they crucified him, along with two others, one on each side and Jesus in the middle. 
\v 19  Pilate had written an inscription to be put on the cross; what he wrote was, JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
\v 20  Now many of the Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus had been crucified was close to the city; besides, the inscription was in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. 
\v 21  So the Jewish high priests said to Pilate, \qt3*Do not write, THE KING OF THE JEWS; write, HE SAID I AM THE KING OF THE JEWS.\qt3 
\v 22  Pilate replied, \qt3*What I have written, I have written.\qt3 
\v 23  Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. But as the tunic was seamless, woven right down in a single piece, 
\v 24  they said to themselves, \qt3*Don't let us tear it. Let us draw lots to see who gets it\qt3 (that the scripture might be fulfilled, they distributed my clothes among them, and drew lots for my raiment). This was what the soldiers did. 
\v 25  Now beside the cross of Jesus stood his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. 
\v 26  So when Jesus saw his mother and his favourite disciple standing near, he said to his mother, \qt3*Woman, there is your son!\qt3 
\v 27  Then he said to the disciple, \qt3*And, there is your mother!\qt3 And from that hour the disciple took her to his home. 
\v 28  After that, as Jesus knew that everything was now finished and fulfilled, he said (to fulfil the scripture), \qt3*I am thirsty.\qt3 
\v 29  A jug full of vinegar was lying there; so they put a sponge full of vinegar on a spear and held it to his lips. 
\v 30  And when Jesus took the vinegar, he said, \qt3*It is finished,\qt3 bowed his head, and gave up his spirit. 
\v 31  Now, as it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies remaining on the cross during the sabbath (for that sabbath-day was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed. 
\v 32  So the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man and of the other man who had been crucified along with him; 
\v 33  but when they came to Jesus and saw he was dead already, they did not break his legs; 
\v 34  only, one of the soldiers pricked his side with a lance, and out came blood and water in a moment. 
\v 35  He who saw it has borne witness (his witness is true; God knows he is telling the truth), that you may believe. 
\v 36  For this took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him will be broken. 
\v 37  And another scripture also says, They shall look on him whom they have impaled. 
\v 38  After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, a disciple of Jesus but a secret disciple — for fear of the Jews — asked Pilate for permission to remove the body of Jesus. And Pilate allowed him. So he went and removed the body, 
\v 39  accompanied by Nicodemus (he who had first come to Jesus by night) who brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds of it; 
\v 40  they took and wrapped up the body of Jesus in the spices and in bandages, according to the Jewish custom of burial. 
\v 41  Now at the spot where he had been crucified there was an orchard, and in the orchard a new tomb where no one had yet been laid; 
\v 42  so they put Jesus there, since it was the Jewish day of Preparation, seeing that the tomb was close by. 
\c 20
\v 1  On the first day of the week Mary of Magdala went early to the tomb, when it was still dark; but as she saw the boulder had been removed from the tomb, 
\v 2  she ran off to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, the favourite of Jesus, telling them, \qt3*They have taken the master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put him!\qt3 
\v 3  So Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb; 
\v 4  they both started to run, but the other disciple ran ahead, faster than Peter, and got to the tomb first. 
\v 5  He glanced in and saw the bandages lying on the ground, but he did not go inside. 
\v 6  Then Simon Peter came after him, and went inside the tomb; he noticed not only that the bandages were lying on the ground 
\v 7  but that the napkin which had been round his head was folded up by itself, instead of lying beside the other bandages. 
\v 8  Upon this the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, went inside too, and when he saw for himself he was convinced. 
\v 9  (For as yet they did not understand the Scripture that he must rise from the dead.) 
\v 10  Then the disciples returned home; 
\v 11  but Mary stood sobbing outside the tomb. As she sobbed, she glanced inside the tomb 
\v 12  and noticed two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. 
\v 13  \qt3*Woman,\qt3 they said to her, \qt3*why are you sobbing?\qt3 She said, \qt3*Because they have taken away my master, and I do not know where they have put him!\qt3 
\v 14  With these words she turned round and noticed Jesus standing — though she did not know it was Jesus. 
\v 15  \qt3*Woman,\qt3 said Jesus, \qt3*why are you sobbing? Who are you looking for?\qt3 Supposing he was the gardener, she said, \qt3*Oh, sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you put him, and I will remove him.\qt3 
\v 16  \qt3*Mary!\qt3 said Jesus. She started round and said, \qt3*Rabboni!\qt3 (a Hebrew word meaning \qt4teacher\qt4*). 
\v 17  Jesus said, \qt3*Cease clinging to me. I have not ascended yet to the Father, but go to my brothers and tell them, \qt2*I am ascending to my Father and yours, to my God and yours.\qt2\qt3 
\v 18  Away went Mary of Magdala to the disciples with the news, \qt3*I have seen the Lord!\qt3 — telling them what he had said to her. 
\v 19  On the evening of that same day — the first day of the week — though the disciples had gathered within closed doors for fear of the Jews, Jesus entered and stood among them, saying, \qt3*Peace be with you!\qt3 
\v 20  So saying he showed them his hands and his side; and when the disciples saw the Lord, they rejoiced. 
\v 21  Jesus then repeated, \qt3*Peace be with you! As the Father sent me forth, I am sending you forth.\qt3 
\v 22  And with these words he breathed on them, and added, \qt3*Receive the holy Spirit! 
\v 23  If you remit the sins of any, they are remitted: if you retain them, they are retained.\qt3 
\v 24  Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called \qt4the Twin,\qt4* was not with them when Jesus came; 
\v 25  and when the rest of the disciples told him, \qt3*We have seen the Lord,\qt3 he said, \qt3*Unless I see his hands with the mark of the nails, and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I refuse to believe it.\qt3 
\v 26  Eight days afterwards his disciples were together again, and Thomas with them. Though the doors were closed, Jesus entered and stood among them, saying, \qt3*Peace be with you!\qt3 
\v 27  Then he said to Thomas, \qt3*Look at my hands, put your finger here; and put your hand here into my side; cease your unbelief and believe.\qt3 
\v 28  Thomas answered him, \qt3*My Lord and my God!\qt3 
\v 29  Jesus said to him, \qt3*You believe because you have seen me? Blessed be those who believe though they have never seen me.\qt3 
\v 30  Many another Sign did Jesus perform in presence of his disciples, which is not recorded in this book; 
\v 31  but these Signs are recorded so that you may believe Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and believing may have life through his Name. 
\c 21
\v 1  After that, Jesus disclosed himself once more to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. It was in this way. 
\v 2  Simon Peter, Thomas (who was called \qt4the Twin\qt4*), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the two sons of Zebedaeus, and two other disciples of his, were all together. 
\v 3  Simon Peter said to them, \qt3*I am going to fish.\qt3 They said, \qt3*We are coming with you too.\qt3 Off they went and embarked in the boat, but that night they caught nothing. 
\v 4  Now at break of day Jesus was standing on the beach (though the disciples did not know it was Jesus). 
\v 5  \qt3*Lads,\qt3 said Jesus, \qt3*have you got anything?\qt3 \qt3*No,\qt3 they answered. 
\v 6  So he told them, \qt3*Throw your net on the right of the boat, and you will have a take.\qt3 At this they threw the net, and now they could not haul it in for the mass of fish. 
\v 7  So the disciple who was Jesus\qt4 favourite said to Peter, \qt5It is the Lord!\qt5* Hearing it was the Lord, Simon Peter threw on his blouse (he was stripped for work) and jumped into the water, 
\v 8  while the rest of the disciples came ashore in the punt (they were not far from land, only about a hundred yards), dragging their netful of fish. 
\v 9  When they got to land, they saw a charcoal fire burning, with fish cooking on it, and some bread. 
\v 10  Jesus said to them, \qt5Bring some of the fish you have just caught.\qt5* 
\v 11  So Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty three of them; but for all their number the net was not torn. 
\v 12  Jesus said, \qt5Come and breakfast.\qt5* (Not one of the disciples dared to ask him who he was; they knew it was the Lord.) 
\v 13  Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too. 
\v 14  This was the third time, now, that Jesus appeared to the disciples after rising from the dead. 
\v 15  Then after breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter, \qt5Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others do?\qt5* \qt5Why, Lord,\qt5* he said, \qt5you know I love you.\qt5* \qt5Then feed my lambs,\qt5* said Jesus. 
\v 16  Again he asked him, for the second time, \qt5Simon, son of John, do you love me?\qt5* \qt5Why, Lord,\qt5* he said, \qt5you know I love you.\qt5* \qt5Then be a shepherd to my sheep,\qt5* said Jesus. 
\v 17  For the third time he asked him, \qt5Simon, son of John, do you love me?\qt5* Now Peter was vexed at being asked a third time, \qt5Do you love me?\qt5* So he replied; \qt5Lord, you know everything, you can see I love you.\qt5* Jesus said, \qt5Then feed my sheep. 
\v 18  Truly, truly I tell you, you put on your own girdle and went wherever you wanted, when you were young; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands for someone to gird you, and you will be taken where you have no wish to go\qt5* 
\v 19  (he said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God); then he added, \qt5Follow me.\qt5* 
\v 20  Peter turned round and saw that the favourite disciple of Jesus was following, the disciple who had leant on his breast at supper and put the question, \qt5Lord, who is to betray you?\qt5* 
\v 21  So, on catching sight of him, Peter said to Jesus, \qt5And what about him, Lord?\qt5* 
\v 22  Jesus replied, \qt5If I choose that he should survive till I come back, what does that matter to you? Follow me yourself.\qt5* 
\v 23  This started the report among the brotherhood that the said disciple was not to die. Jesus, however, did not say he was not to die; what he said was, \qt5If I choose that he should survive till I come back, what does that matter to you?\qt5* 
\v 24  This was the disciple who bears testimony to these facts and who wrote them down; his testimony, we know, is true. 
\v 25  Now there is much else that Jesus did — so much, that if it were written down in detail. I do not suppose the world itself could hold the written records.
