\mt1 JEREMIAH
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The story of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, belonging to the priests at Anathoth in the dis trict of Benjamin;
\v 2 to whom the word of the Eternal came during the reign of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.
\v 3 [[It continued to come during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, when Jerusalem went into exile in the fifth month of that year.]]
\p
\v 4 This word from the Eternal came to me:
\p
\v 5 “Before I formed you in the womb, I chose you; ere ever you were born, I set you apart; I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.”
\p
\v 6 Then I said,
\q1 “Ah, but, O Lord Eternal, I cannot speak,
\q2 I am too young!”
\v 7 But the Eternal said to me, “Say not, you are too young; to whomsoever I send you shall you go, and whatever I command you, shall you speak.
\v 8 Be not afraid at the sight of them, for I am with you to succour you.”
\v 9 The Eternal said it. And then the Eternal put out his hand to touch my mouth: the Eternal said to me, “There! I have put my words into your mouth;
\v 10 here and now I give you authority over nations and kingdoms, to tear up, to break down, to shatter, to pull down, to build up and to plant.”
\p
\v 11 This word from the Eternal came to me: “Jeremiah, what do you see?” I said, “The shoot of a wake-tree.”
\v 12 The Eternal said to me, “You have seen right; for I am wakeful over my word, to carry it out.”
\p
\v 13 The word of the Eternal came to me again, saying, “What do you see?” I said, “A boiling cauldron, fanned from the north.”
\v 14 Then the Eternal said to me, “From the north is bane being blown out on all the inhabitants of the land.
\v 15 For I am summoning all the empires of the north; they shall come and erect their tribunals, each at the entry to Jerusalem and opposite all its walls round about and opposite all the towns of Judah;
\v 16 by them will I pass sentence on all the wickedness of those who forsake me to offer sacrifice to other gods and worship what their own hands made.
\v 17 As for you, brace yourself up, stand up and tell them all that I command you; never be scared at them, lest I scare you at the sight of them.
\v 18 I--I fortify you this day like a town, a bronze wall, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, the authorities, the priests and the laity;
\v 19 they shall attack you, but they shall not overcome you, for I am with you (the Eternal promises) to succour you.”
\c 2
\p
\v 1 The word of the Eternal came to me,
\v 2 bidding me go and proclaim this message from the Eternal in the hearing of Jerusalem:
\q1 remember your early devotion,
\q2 the love of your bridal days
\q1 how through the wolds you followed me,
\q2 through lands unsown;
\v 3
\q1 Israel was set apart for the Eternal,
\q2 so dear to him, so sacred
\q1 that her spoilers were all punished;
\q2 ill befell them.”
\v 4
\q1 Listen to the Eternal’s word, O house of Jacob and all families of the house of Israel:
\v 5
\q1 “What did your fathers find wrong in me that they went far from me,
\q2 went after empty idols and became empty themselves?
\v 6
\q1 They never said, ‘Where is the Eternal, who brought us up from Egypt’s land
\q1 who led us through the desert, through a land of steppes and holes,
\q1 through a land of drought and darkness deep,
\q1 a land where no one travels, no one dwells?’
\v 7
\q1 Yes, and I brought you to a garden-land, to eat the fruit and good things of it
\q1 but when you entered, you befouled my land and made my heritage abominable--
\v 8
\q1 the priests never asked, ‘Where is the Eternal?’
\q1 those who handled the law cared nothing for me,
\q1 the rulers rebelled against me,
\q1 the prophets prophesied by Baal and sought useless idols.
\v 9
\q1 So I must still indict you, the Eternal says,
\q2 and indict your children’s children;
\v 10
\q1 cross to Cyprus and the west, and see,
\q1 send east to the Arabs, and inquire--
\q1 see if there ever was the like of this;
\v 11
\q1 has any nation ever changed its gods (gods that are no gods)?
\q1 But my people have changed their Glory for a useless thing!
\v 12
\q1 Well may the heavens be appalled and shudder;
\v 13
\q1 for my people have done double wrong,
\q1 they have forsaken me, the reservoir of fresh water,
\q1 and hewn out cisterns for themselves,
\q1 leaky cisterns that cannot hold any water!
\p
\v 14
\q1 Is Israel a defenceless serf
\q2 a home-born slave,
\q1 that he should be plundered
\q2 and his towns laid waste?
\p
\v 15
\q1 Young lions roar at him,
\q2 growling aloud;
\q1 they lay his land desolate
\q2 empty of inhabitants;
\p
\v 16
\q1 men of Memphis and of Daphn
\q2 strip you to be slaves;
\v 17
\q1 have you not brought this on yourself,
\q2 by abandoning your God?
\p
\v 18
\q1 What right had you to go to Egypt,
\q2 to drink from the Nile?
\q1 What right had you to go to Assyria,
\q2 to drink from the Euphrates?
\v 19
\q1 Your own wickedness will punish you,
\q2 your apostasy will chastise you.
\q1 See for yourself how sore it is for you
\q2 to abandon me,
\q1 to have no reverence for me
\q2 says the Lord, the Lord of hosts.
\v 20
\q1 Long ago you broke your yok
\q2 and snapped your harness,
\q1 you said, ‘I will not serve thee’;
\q2 and on every height,
\q1 under every green tree
\q2 you wantoned like a harlot.
\v 21
\q1 Yet I had planted you a noble vine,
\q2 of right good stock.
\q1 And into what a foul thing you have turned,
\q2 a vine wild and degenerate!
\v 22
\q1 You may wash yourself with ly
\q2 and plenty soap,
\q1 but I see your sin of the deepest dye,
\q2 says the Lord Eternal.
\v 23
\q1 How dare you say, ‘I am not stained,
\q2 I have not sought the Baals’
\q1 Look at your life in the Valley
\q2 think how you have carried on:
\q1 you are a swift young camel
\q2 that doubles on her tracks,
\v 24
\q1 a heifer running wild in the wold,
\q2 heated with passion
\q1 snuffing the breeze, in the rutting season-
\q2 who can control her?
\q1 No male need trouble to search for her;
\q2 all can find her at mating-time.
\v 25
\q1 Do not run your feet bare,
\q2 your throat dry.
\q1 But ‘It is no use to talk;
\q2 I am in love with foreign gods,’ you cry,
\q2 ‘and after them I hie.’
\p
\v 26
\q1 Like a thief caught and confounded,
\q2 so shall Israel’s house be confounded,
\v 27
\q1 calling a pole ‘my father,’
\q2 calling a pillar ‘my mother’!
\p
\q1 They have turned their backs to me,
\q2 and not their faces
\q1 and yet they cry, when trouble comes,
\q2 ‘Arise and save us’!
\v 28
\q1 But where are your gods,
\q2 the gods you made for yourself?
\q1 Let them arise to save you,
\q2 if they can, in your trouble!
\p
\q1 (for you have as many god
\q2 as towns, O Judah;
\q1 and as the streets are in Jerusalem,
\q2 so sacrifices abound to Baal.)
\p
\v 29
\q1 Then why upbraid me,
\q2 when you are godless, all
\q1 when you are rebels, all?--
\q2 the Eternal protests.
\p
\v 30
\q1 In vain I struck your citizens,
\q2 they would not be corrected;
\q1 the sword devoured your prophets
\q2 like a lion, a man-eater,
\v 31
\q1 but fear you would not,
\q2 would not heed the word of the Eternal.
\p
\q1 Have I been a desert to Israel
\q2 or a land of gloom?
\q1 Then why do my people say, ‘We please ourselves,
\q2 we will not come to thee’?
\p
\v 32
\q1 Can a girl forget her trinkets
\q2 or a bride her sash?
\q1 And yet my people have forgotten me,
\q2 days without number!
\p
\v 33
\q1 Your course you have directed
\q2 to intrigues of love,
\q1 and trained yourself to follow
\q2 evil paths;
\p
\v 34
\q1 your hands are stained
\q2 with innocent blood;
\q1 and for all thi
\q2 I will arraign you.
\v 35
\q1 Yet you say, ‘I am innocent
\q2 surely his anger is over.’
\q1 I will condemn you for saying,
\q2 ‘I have not sinned.’
\v 36
\q1 Why do you cheapen yourself
\q2 by shifting your course
\q1 you will find Egypt fail you
\q2 as Assyria did;
\v 37
\q1 you will have to leave Egypt also,
\q2 hands clasped on head for shame;
\q1 for the Eternal has rejected those you rely on
\q2 and nothing will you gain by them.
\c 3
\p
\v 1
\q1 . . . saying, if any man divorce his wife
\q2 and she leaves him
\q1 if she belongs to another man
\q2 can she come back to him
\q1 Would not a woman like that
\q2 be wholly polluted?
\q1 And you, who have wantoned with many a lover
\q2 you would come back to me!-
\q2 says the Eternal.
\v 2
\q1 Look up at the bare heights, see!
\q2 Where have not men lain with you?
\q1 You sat awaiting lovers by the road-side,
\q2 like a nomad in the desert
\q1 you have polluted the lan
\q2 with your harlotry and vice;
\v 3
\q1 your host of lovers
\q2 has been a snare to you
\q1 and yet you were as brazen as a harlot,
\q2 you would not blush for it.
\v 4
\q1 And now you begin to call me
\q2 ‘Dear bridegroom of my youth’!
\v 5
\q1 ‘He will not keep it up,’ you say
\q2 ‘he will not be angry for ever!’
\q1 So you say, but what you do
\q2 is vilest of the vile.”
\v 6 [[During the reign of king Josiah, the Eternal said to me, “Have you seen what turncoat Israel has done, going up every height, going under every green tree, and playing the harlot there?
\v 7 I thought, after all that, she would surely turn back to me. But she did not turn back; and although her faithless sister Judah saw plainly that,
\v 8 as Israel had committed adultery, I had divorced her and handed her a bill of divorce, yet Judah her faithless sister was not afraid; she too went and played the harlot.
\v 9 The light-hearted wanton, she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees!
\v 10 Yet, for all that, this faithless Judah has not turned back to me with her whole heart, but insincerely.”
\v 11 So the Eternal said to me, “Turncoat Israel has proved herself better than faithless Judah.
\v 12 Go and proclaim this northward; say,
\q1 ‘Turn again, turncoat Israel, turn to me
\q2 the Eternal pleads;
\q1 I will not frown on you, for I am merciful,
\q2 I will not keep it up against you.
\v 13
\q1 Only acknowledge your guilt, confess
\q2 you have rebelled against the Eternal, your own God,
\q1 and lavished love on foreign gods under all green trees
\q2 and refused to listen to my voice, says the Eternal.’ ”]]
\v 14 [[“Turn back, O turncoat children, says the Eternal, for it is I who am your lord; I will take one or two of you, one from a town here, two from a clan there, and bring you to Sion,
\v 15 where I will give you rulers after my own heart who shall furnish you with knowledge and with sense.
\v 16 In after days, when you become numerous and fruitful in the land, says the Eternal, men shall no longer speak of ‘the ark of the Eternal’s compact’; that shall never enter their minds, they shall not remember it, they shall never miss it, and it shall never be re-made.
\v 17 They shall call Jerusalem then ‘the throne of the Eternal’; and all nations shall gather to it, living no longer by the stubbornness of their evil minds.
\v 18 In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and they shall come out of the north-land together to the land that I gave as a heritage to your fathers.”]]
\v 19
\q1 I thought that I would treat you like a son,
\q2 and give you a delightful land
\q2 the fairest heritage of any nation.
\q1 I thought that you would call me Father,
\q2 and never turn away from me.
\v 20
\q1 But as a wife betrays her husband for her lover
\q2 so you have betrayed me,
\q2 O house of Israel--says the Eternal.
\p
\v 21
\q1 Hark, I hear them on the bare heights,
\q2 Israel beseeching and bewailing;
\q1 for they have wilfully gone astray,
\q2 ignoring the Eternal One, their God.
\v 22
\q1 Turn back, you turncoat children,
\q2 and I will heal your hurt.
\p
\q1 “Here we come, we come to thee,
\q2 for thou art our own God.
\v 23
\q1 These hills are no help,
\q2 these orgies on the mountains
\q1 Only in the Eternal One, our God,
\q2 lies any help for Israel.
\v 24
\q1 Baal-worship has always devoured
\q2 the fruit of our fathers’ toil,
\q1 their flocks and herds
\q2 their sons and daughters.
\v 25
\q1 Let us lie down then in our shame,
\q2 let our dishonour cover us;
\q1 for we have sinned against our God,
\q2 both we and our fathers
\q2 from our youth till now,
\q1 and never have we listene
\q2 to the voice of our own God.”
\c 4
\p
\v 1
\q1 [[If you will turn back, O Israel,
\q2 if you will turn to me
\q1 if you will put away your idols vile
\q2 and never stray from my sight,
\v 2
\q1 if you will swear, “As the Eternal lives!”
\q2 from lives just, honest, right,
\q1 then shall the nations seek their bliss through him
\q2 and glory in him.]]
\v 3 Here is the word of the Eternal for the men of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem:
\q1 “Break up your fallow ground
\q2 never sow among thorns;
\v 4
\q1 when you devote yourselves to the Eternal
\q2 devote your hearts;
\q1 lest my fury blaze and bum like fire,
\q2 past quenching, for your evil deeds.”
    * * *
\v 5
\q1 Utter this in Judah and Jerusalem,
\q2 proclaim it and announce it,
\q1 blow the trumpet through the land,
\q2 shout this aloud:
\q1 “Let all gather and escap
\q2 to the fortified towns!”
\v 6
\q1 Hoist the signal for Sion;
\q2 quick, run to cover!
\q1 For calamity is coming from the north,
\q2 and dire disaster.
\v 7
\q1 The lion is up from his lair,
\q2 the havoc of nations;
\q1 he has broken loose, he strides ahead
\q2 to harry the earth!
\v 8
\q1 Gird on sackcloth then,
\q2 lament and wail;
\q1 for it will not turn from us
\q2 the Eternal’s fierce anger.
\v 9
\q1 [[That day, says the Eternal,
\q2 the courage of king and chiefs will fail,
\q1 the priests shall be appalled
\q2 and the prophets aghast;
\v 10
\q1 “Ah, Lord Eternal,” they will cry,
\q2 “thou hast deceived this people utterly!
\q1 Thou didst promise peace to them,
\q2 and here the sword cuts to the very soul!”
\v 11
\q1 At that time this people and Jerusalem shall be told:
\q1 “A hot blast blows from the desert
\q2 on my country-folk,
\v 12
\q1 no breeze to winnow and to cleanse,
\q2 but a wild, tearing wind
\q2 for now I sentence them.]]
\v 13
\q1 The foe comes up like driving clouds,
\q2 his chariots like a hurricane,
\q1 his horses swifter than a vulture’s swoop--
\q2 woe betide us! we are undone!
\v 15
\q1 Hark, a message from Dan,
\q2 bad news from the hills of Ephraim!
\v 16
\q1 Proclaim the warning in Jerusalem:
\q1 “Leopards are leaping from a far land
\q1 leaping and growling at the townships of Judah,
\v 17
\q1 lurking out there in the fields,
\q2 round her on every side;
\q1 for she has defied me
\q2 says the Lord of hosts.”
\p
\v 18
\q1 You have brought it all upon yourself
\q2 by the way you lived
\q1 your evil drives it to your heart
\q2 this bitter, mortal stroke.
\v 14
\q1 Wash your heart clean of evil
\q2 to be saved, Jerusalem.
\q1 How long are wicked plan
\q2 to lodge with you?
\p
\v 19
\q1 O my heart, my heart! it writhes!
\q2 Oh how it throbs!
\q1 My soul is moaning!
\q2 I cannot hold my peace,
\q1 for I hear the blare of trumpet
\q2 and the battle-cry.
\v 20
\q1 Crash upon crash!--
\q2 the whole country is down
\q1 our tents are laid low in a second,
\q2 our curtains tom down in a second!
\v 21
\q1 How long must I see war-signal
\q2 and hear trumpet-blasts?
\v 22
\q1 My people are senseless,
\q2 they care not for the Eternal;
\q1 dolts of a household
\q2 devoid of understanding,
\q1 they well know how to do wrong
\q2 but have no mind to do right.
\p
\v 23
\q1 I look out on earth--lo, all is chaos,
\q2 I look at heaven—its light is gone,
\v 24
\q1 I look out on the mountains--they are reeling
\q2 and all the hills are swaying!
\v 25
\q1 I look out--lo, no man is to be seen,
\q2 the very birds have flown!
\v 26
\q1 I look out--lo, the corn-land lies a desert,
\q2 the towns all razed by the Eternal’s rage.
\v 27
\q1 For this is what the Eternal has decreed:
\q2 “The land shall all be desolate;
\v 28
\q1 earth shall mourn over it,
\q2 and heaven above wear black
\q1 but I will not repent of my resolve,
\q2 and from my purpose I will not go back.
\p
\v 29
\q1 At the noise of the horsemen and archers
\q2 the land is all in flight,
\q1 men taking cover within woods and caves,
\q2 and clambering the rocks;
\q1 every township is abandoned
\q2 not one soul is left.
\v 30
\q1 You ruined creature, what will you do?
\q2 Array yourself in scarlet?
\q1 Deck yourself out in gold, and paint your' eyes?-
\q2 you beautify yourself in vain!
\q1 Your paramours despise you
\q2 they are out for your life.
\p
\v 31
\q1 Hark! the scream of a woman in labour,
\q2 her cry as she bears her firstborn!--
\q1 ’tis the shriek of maiden Sion
\q2 panting, clutching for help
\q1 crying, ‘Oh and alas! all is over
\q2 they are murdering me!’
\c 5
\p
\v 1
\q1 Scour the streets of Jerusalem,
\q2 search the squares and se
\q1 if you can find a man of honest mind
\q2 and true integrity.
\v 2
\q1 They may swear, ‘As the Eternal lives!’
\q2 but the oath is perjury.
\p
\v 3
\q1 O thou Eternal, what thou look- est for
\q2 is honesty, not falsehood.
\q1 Thou hast struck them, but they smarted not
\q2 they would not learn:
\q1 they hardened themselves like a flint,
\q2 they would not turn.
\p
\v 4
\q1 ‘But these are the poor,’ I said
\q2 ‘mere ignorant folk,
\q1 who never learned the rules of the Eternal
\q2 or the religion of their God.
\v 5
\q1 I will turn to the upper classes
\q2 I will talk to them;
\q1 for they have learned the rules of the Eternal,
\q2 and the religion of their God.’
\q1 But they had flung off all restraints,
\q2 and broken every bond.
\p
\v 6
\q1 So a lion from the jungle shall slay them,
\q2 a wolf from the steppes;
\q1 a leopard shall prowl around their towns,
\q2 till he who ventures out is torn in pieces;
\q1 for they have sinned repeatedly
\q2 and lapsed over and again.”
\p
\v 7
\q1 “How can I pardon them?”
\q2 the Eternal asks;
\q1 “for they have abandoned m
\q2 and sworn by gods that are no gods.
\q1 I gave them their fill, and they turned to vice,
\q2 they were at home in a harlot’s house--
\v 8
\q1 pampered horses, lusty stallions
\q2 neighing each for his neighbour’s wife!
\v 9
\q1 Must I not punish them for that?”
\q2 the Eternal asks;
\q1 “shall I not make such people pay for that?”
\p
\v 10
\q1 Get in among her vines and ravage them!
\q2 Strip off her branches—they are not the Eternal’s!
\v 11
\q1 For Israel’s house and Judah’s house
\q2 have been full faithless to him.
\v 12
\q1 They have belied the Eternal,
\q2 crying, “He will do nothing
\q1 No harm can come to us
\q2 no suffering from war or famine.
\v 13
\q1 The prophets are but windbags;
\q2 the Word is not with them!”
\p
\v 14
\q1 So the Eternal, God of hosts, declares,
\q2 “Since thus they talk,
\q1 I put my Word into your mouth, Jeremiah,
\q1 to be a fire,
\q1 and I will make this people fue
\q2 to be burned.”
\p
\v 15
\q1 “I bring a nation on you from afar,
\q2 O house of Israel,” says the Eternal;
\q1 “a nation that endures
\q2 an ancient nation
\q1 with a language that you know not,
\q2 and speech you cannot understand.
\p
\v 16
\q1 Their arrows deal death far and wide;
\q2 they are all fighting men.
\v 17
\q1 They shall devour your harvest and your food
\q2 your flocks and herds;
\q1 they shall devour your grapes and figs,
\q2 and sword in hand shall batter down
\q2 your vaunted forts, each walled town.”
\v 18
\q1 [[Yet even then, the Eternal declares,
\q2 I will not make a clean end of you.
\v 19 And when they ask, “Why has the Eternal our God done all this to us?” you shall tell them, “Just as you forsook me to serve foreign gods in your own land, so you must serve foreigners in a land that is not your own.”]]
\p
\v 20
\q1 Proclaim this to the house of Jacob,
\q2 announce it within Judah
\v 21
\q1 “Listen, you foolish, senseless folk,
\q2 with eyes that see not
\q2 with ears that hear not;
\v 22
\q1 will you not fear me, says the Eternal,
\q2 will you not tremble at my presence?
\q1 I set the sands to bound the deep,
\q2 a barrier that no breakers shall o’erleap;
\q1 the sea may toss, but it cannot prevail,
\q2 the waves may roar, but they cannot reach further.
\v 23
\q1 Yet this folk is at heart restless, rebellious;
\q2 they swerve aside, defiantly.
\v 24
\q1 They never say to themselves,
\q2 ‘Come, let us fear the Eternal our God,
\q1 who sends the rain in spring and autumn due,
\q2 and brings our harvest in its season true.’
\v 25
\q1 It is your crimes that keep such blessings back,
\q2 your sins that spoil your welfare.
\v 26
\q1 For rogues are to be found among my folk
\q2 who set their snares to trap their fellows:
\v 27
\q1 like cages filled with birds,
\q2 their houses are full of swindling gains.
\v 28
\q1 Thus they become great men and prosperous,
\q2 grow stout and sleek;
\q1 they go to any length in crime,
\q2 but make no move for justice;
\q1 they never champion an orphan’s cause
\q2 or rally to a poor man’s rights.
\v 29
\q1 Must I not punish them for that?”
\q2 the Eternal asks;
\q1 “shall I not make such peopl
\q2 pay for that?”
\p
\v 30
\q1 A horrible thing, an appalling,
\q2 has happened in the land:
\v 31
\q1 the prophets prophesy falsely,
\q2 the priests rule at their beck and call,
\q1 and my people love to have it so!
\q2 But what will you do, at the end of it all?
\c 6
\p
\v 1
\q1 Fly for safety, men of Benjamin,
\q2 fly from Jerusalem,
\q1 blow the trumpet in Tekoah
\q2 light a beacon on Beth-hakkherem;
\q1 for trouble is looming out of the north
\q2 ay, fell disaster.
\v 2
\q1 Is it a meadow fair,
\q2 the higher slopes of Sion?
\v 3
\q1 Yet shepherds grim are bringing flocks,
\q2 and pitching tents around
\q2 as though they owned the ground.
\v 4
\q1 “Open the campaign,” they cry
\q2 “come on, let us attack at noon!”--
\q1 “Pity the day is declining
\q2 the shadows are lengthening!”
\v 5
\q1 “Come on, let us attack by night,
\q2 and wreck her palaces!”
\v 6
\q1 For these are their orders from the Lord of hosts:
\q2 “Cut down the trees of the country,
\q2 set siege-mounds up against Jerusalem!”
\q1 “Ah, the false city
\q2 harbouring only oppression!
\v 7
\q1 She keeps her evils fresh,
\q2 as a cistern keeps its water.
\q1 Sounds rise from her of outrage and oppression;
\q2 I am always seeing wounds and blows.
\v 8
\q1 Take warning, O Jerusalem,
\q2 or I will break with you,
\q1 or I will lay you waste
\q2 and leave you uninhabited.
\v 9
\q1 Go over what is left
\q2 of Israel’s vineyard,
\q1 scan her as a gardener scan
\q2 twig after twig;
\v 10
\q1 is there a man whom I can warn,
\q2 and make him listen?
\q1 No, this people’s ears are stopped,
\q2 they never heed me.
\q1 Why, the Eternal’s word is a disgust to them
\q2 and no delight!
\p
\v 11
\q1 So I am pent up with my wrath
\q2 weary of holding it in;
\q1 vent it I must, on children in the street,
\q2 on gatherings of young men;
\q1 husband and wife shall be seized together,
\q2 old folk and middle-aged.
\v 12
\q1 Their houses shall be turned over to strangers,
\q2 their wives along with their lands.
\v 13
\q1 For high and low alike are al
\q2 greedy for gain;
\q1 prophet and priest alik
\q2 are all deceitful,
\v 14
\q1 treating the wounds of my people
\q2 slightly and lightly,
\q1 saying ‘All’s well, all’s well,
\q2 when all is not well.
\v 15
\q1 Are they ashamed at their abominable deeds?
\q2 Not they! They know not how to blush.
\q1 Therefore they shall fall among the fallen,
\q2 collapsing when I punish them,” says the Eternal.
\p
\v 16
\q1 “Stand at the cross-roads,” the Eternal said,
\q2 “and look for the old path,
\q1 ask for the good road and take it,
\q2 so shall you be safe and prosper.”
\v 17
\q2 But they said, “We will not take it.”
\q1 I posted sentinels for them,
\q2 I bade them listen to the trumpet-blast;
\q2 they said, “We will not listen.”
\p
\v 18
\q1 Hear then, O heavens,
\q2 bear witness against them;
\v 19
\q1 hear, O earth,
\q2 for I bring evil on this people,
\q2 the outcome of their apostasy
\q1 since they would not heed my words,
\q2 and my directions they rejected.

\q1 (What care I for incense,
\q2 that you bring from Sheba,
\q1 or for perfume fetche
\q2 from lands afar?
\q1 I will not accept your offerings,
\q2 I have no pleasure in your sacrifices.)
\v 21
\q1 Therefore--it is the Eternal’s word--
\q2 I lay stumbling-blocks before this people;
\q1 father and son shall both trip over them,
\q2 neighbour and friend shall perish.
\v 22 Here is the Eternal’s word:
\q1 “A people is coming
\q2 out of the north-land
\q1 a power is stirrin
\q2 from the far ends of earth!
\v 23
\q1 Bow and javelin they seize
\q2 they are cruel, pitiless;
\q1 their din is like the roaring sea
\q2 they ride on horses,
\q1 mustering like one man
\q1 to fight you, maiden Sion.”
\p
\v 24
\q1 “We have heard the news,
\q2 and our hands are limp,
\q1 panic has seized us,
\q2 pain like a woman’s in travail.”
\p
\v 25
\q1 “Then venture not into the country,
\q2 walk not on the road;
\q1 for the foe has a sword,
\q2 and terror is abroad.
\v 26
\q1 Gird on sackcloth, my daughter, my people,
\q2 sprinkle yourself with ashes
\q1 mourn as for an only son
\q2 lamenting bitterly;
\q1 for suddenly the spoile
\q2 falls upon you.”
\p
\v 27
\q1 “I have made you an assayer for my folk,
\q2 to learn and to assay their life--
\v 28
\q1 rebellious creatures, all of them,
\q1 slandering me up and down!
\q1 base metal, all of them,
\q2 wholly depraved!
\v 29
\q1 The bellows make a blast,
\q2 the fire consumes the lead;
\q1 but vain it is to smelt them,
\q2 for the slag cannot be purged away.

\q1 ‘Refuse silver’ is their name;
\q1 for the Eternal refuses to have them.”

\v 1 The message that came to m Jeremiah from the Eternal:
\v 2 Stand at the gate of the Eternal’s house and make this proclamation there. “Listen to the Eternal’s message, all you Judahites, who enter by these gates to worship the Eternal;
\v 3 here is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, has to say. Amend your life and doings, that I may dwell among you in the temple here.
\v 4 Never rely on false phrases like, ‘This is the Eternal’s own temple, his very own temple, his very own temple!’
\v 5 [[If you really amend your life and doings, if you really see justice done between man and man,
\v 6 if you give up oppressing aliens, orphans, and widows, give up shedding innocent blood in this place and following other gods to your own hurt,
\v 7 then I will allow you to remain in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers for all time.]]
\v 8 You are relying on false phrases, to no profit.
\v 9 What? Steal, murder, commit adultery, perjure yourselves, sacrifice to Baal, wander after other, outside gods,
\v 10 and then come to present yourselves before me in this house, which belongs to me, thinking you are now quite safe--safe to go on with all these abominable practices!
\v 11 Do you take this house, my very own house, for a robbers’ cave? I see you, the Eternal cries, I see you!
\v 12 Go to my sacred shrine at Shilo, where at first I fixed my presence; look at what I did to it, on account of the wickedness of Israel my people!
\v 13 So now with you. Since you have done all this, since you would not listen when I spoke to you eagerly and earnestly, since you would not answer my call--as I did to Shilo,
\v 14 so will I do to my very own house here, the house on which you rest your confidence, the place that I gave to you and your fathers.
\v 15 And I will fling you out of my sight, as I flung out your kinsmen, the whole race of Ephraim.
\p
\v 16 Jeremiah, pray not for this people; lift no cry for them, and lay no plea of intercession before me, for I will not listen to you.
\v 17 Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
\v 18 The children are gathering firewood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven; also they pour libations out to other gods--in order to spite me!
\v 19 Spite me? says the Eternal--they are spiting themselves, bringing shame on themselves!
\v 20 This, therefore, is the sentence of the Lord Eternal: my anger and fury shall be poured on this place, over man and beast, tree and crop; it shall burn, never to be quenched.”
\p
\v 21 This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: “You can add your burnt-offerings to your other sacrifices, and eat the flesh yourselves!
\v 22 When I brought your fathers from the land of Egypt, I said nothing to them, I gave them no orders, about burnt-offerings or sacrifices;
\v 23 my orders were, ‘Listen to my voice, and I will be your God, as you shall be my people: live exactly as I order you, that you may prosper.’
\v 24 But they would not listen, they would not lend an ear; they lived as their own evil, stubborn hearts prompted them; they grew worse instead of better.
\v 25 From the day your fathers left the land of Egypt, down to this day, I have been sending you all my servants the prophets eagerly and earnestly.
\v 26 But this people would not listen to me, they would not lend an ear; they were obdurate, they did worse than their fathers.
\v 27
\q1 [[Tell them all this
\q2 yet they will not listen to you;
\q1 summon them,
\q2 yet they will not reply.]]
\v 28
\q1 Tell them, here is the nation
\q2 that would never listen
\q1 to the voice of the Eternal
\q2 their own God,
\q1 that never would be schooled,
\q2 that has ceased even to speak of being faithful.”
\p
\v 29
\q1 “Cut off your tresses, cast them away,
\q2 raise dirges on the bare heights;
\q1 for the Eternal has rejected and renounced
\q2 a race with whom he is wroth.
\p
\v 30 For the men of Judah have done evil under my eyes,” says the Eternal; “they have defiled the house that belongs to me, by putting their detestable idols inside it,
\v 31 and they have erected shrines to Topheth, in the valley belonging to Ben-Hinnom, for burning alive their sons and daughters--a thing that I never ordered, a thing that never entered my mind!
\v 32 So the day will come, the Eternal declares, when its name shall no longer be Topheth, or The valley belonging to Ben-Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter; for they will be burying corpses in Topheth, till no room is left.
\v 33 The corpses of this people shall be food for wild birds and wild beasts; no one shall scare them away.
\v 34 And I will silence in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the sound of mirth and joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; the land shall lie waste.
\c 8
\v 1 At this time, says the Eternal, the bones of the kings of Judah, the authorities, the priests, the prophets, and the citizens of Jerusalem, shall be torn from their graves
\v 2 and spread out before the sun, the moon, and all the starry host, whom they loved and served, whom they followed and consulted, whom they worshipped; instead of being gathered and buried, they shall be so much dung on the surface of the earth.
\v 3 And wherever I scatter the rest, all the survivors of this evil race, they shall prefer death to fife, says the Lord of hosts.
\p
\v 4 Tell them that this is the Eternal’s word;
\q1 Does not a man get up when he has fallen?
\q2 Do men not retrace their steps, after a wrong turning?
\v 5
\q1 Then why does this people persist,
\q2 when they have taken a wrong turning?
\q1 They stick fast to their falsehood,
\q2 they will not retrace their steps.
\p
\v 6
\q1 I have listened and heard what they say;
\q2 not a word of the truth!--
\q1 not a man repenting of his sin,
\q2 saying, ‘What have I done?’
\q1 Everyone plunges ahead,
\q2 like a cavalry charge!
\v 7
\q1 The very stork of the air
\q2 knows when to migrate;
\q1 the dove, the swift, the crane,
\q2 keep to the time of their coming;
\q1 but my people never heed
\q2 the Eternal’s ruling.
\v 8
\q1 What! you say, ‘We are wise,
\q2 we do have his directions’--
\q1 when lo, your scribes have written them wrong,
\q2 and falsified them?
\v 9
\q1 No, the ‘wise’ shall be discom­fited,
\q2 dismayed and tricked.
\q1 They have rejected the Eternal’s word;
\q2 so what ‘wisdom’ have they?
\v 13
\q1 I will destroy them utterly, says the Eternal,
\q2 for there are no grapes on that vine,
\q1 no figs on that fig-tree--
\q2 their leaf is fading!”
\p
\v 14
\q1 “Why sit we still?
\q2 Let us gather together
\q1 and make for the fortified towns,
\q2 to meet our doom there!
\q1 For our God has doomed us to perish,
\q2 has drugged us with poison,
\q2 for sinning against him!
\v 15
\q1 We looked for peace,
\q2 but no good came;
\q1 for an hour of healing,
\q2 and here is dismay!
\v 16
\q1 We can hear the foemen’s horses
\q2 snorting as far north as Dan;
\q1 at the neighing of his stallions
\q2 the whole country quakes;
\q1 the land is laid bare, at their coming,
\q2 the city stripped of citizens.”
\v 17
\q1 “Yes, I am sending you serpents,
\q2 snakes that none can charm;
\q1 and they shall bite you,”
\q2 the Eternal declares.
\p
\v 18
\q1 My sorrow is past healing,
\q2 my heart is sick within me.
\v 19
\q1 Look at my poor people
\q2 moaning far and wide--
\q1 “Is the Eternal not in Sion?
\q2 Has her King left her?
\v 20
\q1 Summer is over, the harvest is ended--
\q2 with nothing to keep us alive!”
\v 21
\q1 My poor people, they are broken,
\q2 and I am broken-hearted;
\q1 I go a-mourning,
\q2 seized with dire dismay.
\v 22
\q1 Surely Gilead has balsam!
\q2 Surely there are healers there!
\q1 Then why does my poor people
\q2 get no healing for their wound?
\c 9
\p
\v 1
\q1 Oh that my head were waters, mine eyes a fount of tears,
\q1 that I might weep all day and night
\q2 for the slain of my poor people!
\p
\v 2
\q1 Oh that I were in the wolds
\q2 at a khan for wayfarers!
\q1 For fain would I forsake my people
\q2 and be quit of them!
\q1 They are adulterers, all of them,
\q2 a gang of faithless men;
\v 3
\q1 they ply their tongues
\q2 like bows, for slander;
\q1 they are a power for dishonesty,
\q2 not for honesty, in the land.
\q1 They pass from one crime to another,
\q2 “ignoring me,” says the Eternal.
\v 4
\q1 Beware of your neighbours,
\q2 let no one trust his brother;
\q1 for a brother will cheat like a Jacob,
\q2 and a neighbour will be slandering;
\v 5
\q1 each deceives the other,
\q2 no one tells the truth,
\q1 they train themselves to lie,
\q2 these knaves and fools,
\q1 they oppress and oppress,
\v 6
\q2 they deceive and deceive,
\q1 and-—“they choose to ignore me,”
\q2 says the Eternal.
\p
\v 7
\q1 “Therefore”--the Lord of hosts declares--
\q2 “I must test them in the melting-pot;
\q1 for how can I overlook
\q2 my people’s crimes?
\v 4
\q1 Their tongues are deadly arrows,
\q2 with their treacherous talk;
\q1 a man speaks to his neighbour peaceably,
\q2 and secretly he plots against him.
\v 9
\q1 Must I not punish them for that?”
\q2 the Eternal asks;
\q1 “shall I not make such people
\q2 pay for that?
\v 10
\q1 Raise a lament for the mountains,
\q2 a dirge for the downs,
\q1 wasted and emptied of men;
\q2 no lowing of cattle in them--
\q1 all creatures have fled and gone,
\q2 both bird and beast;
\v 11
\q1 and Jerusalem I will turn into a heap of ruins,
\q2 a mere haunt of jackals;
\q1 the townships of Judah I will lay bare,
\q2 till none dwells there.”
\v 12
\q1 [[Who is wise enough to understand this?
\q2 Who is in the Eternal’s confidence to know
\q1 why the country is so ruined,
\q2 like a desert waste untravelled?
\v 13
\q1 “Because they have forsaken
\q2 the law I put before them,
\q1 and disobeyed my orders,
\q2 and not lived as I told them;
\v 14
\q1 because they followed their own stubborn minds,
\q2 and Baals, as their fathers taught them;
\v 15 therefore,” says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,
\q1 “I will feed this people with bitter wormwood
\q2 and give them poisonous drugs,
\v 16
\q1 I will scatter them among nations
\q2 unknown to them and their fathers,
\q1 and after them I send the sword,
\q2 till I have done away with them.”]]
\p
\v 17
\q1 Listen, call the mourning women,
\q2 call them to come!
\q1 Send for those well-skilled in dirges,
\v 18
\q2 call them quick to come!--
\q1 to raise a coronach over us,
\q2 till our own eyes run down with tears,
\q2 and floods gush from our eyelids.
\v 20
\q1 Yet listen to the Eternal, O ye women,
\q2 let your ears take in his words,
\q1 ere you teach your daughters a lament,
\q2 or a dirge to your fellows;
\v 19
\q1 listen to this wail from Sion--
\q2 “What ruin, what dishonour!
\q1 forced to leave our country,
\q2 forced away from home!
\v 21
\q1 Death has climbed in at our windows,
\q2 made his way into our halls,
\q1 Death cuts down children in the street,
\q2 and young men in the square;

\v 1 Listen to the word of the Eternal for you, O house of Israel; here is what the Eternal says:
\v 2
\q1 Never learn to live like pagans,
\q2 dismayed at portents in the sky;
\q1 pagans are dismayed at them,
\v 3
\q2 but their rites are inane.
\q1 Here is a tree felled from the forest,
\q2 trimmed by a woodman’s axe,
\v 4
\q1 decked out with silver and with gold,
\v 9
\q2 with plates of silver from Tartessus,
\q1 with gold from Ophir,
\q2 all jewellers’ and joiners’ work,
\q1 decked out in violet and purple cloth,
\q2 the work of craftsmen,
\v 4
\q1 then propped with nails and hammer,
\q2 to keep it from falling!
\v 5
\q1 Idols are like scarecrows in a field,
\q2 they cannot say a word;
\q1 they have to be carried,
\q2 for they cannot move a step.
\q1 Have no fear of them; they cannot hurt you--
\q2 no, nor help you!

\q1 [[There is none like thee, O Eternal;
\q2 great thou art, great thy presence in its power!

\q1 O King of nations, who would not revere thee?
\q2 For reverence is thy due;
\q1 no sage, no royalty, in all the world,
\q2 none is like thee.]]
\p
\v 8
\q1 Stupid and senseless are they, one and all--
\q2 what idols teach is wooden like themselves!
\v 10
\q1 But the Eternal is the real God,
\q2 a living God, an everlasting King;
\q1 earth trembles when he rages,
\q2 no nation can endure his wrath
\v 11 [[Tell them this: the gods who never made heaven and earth shall vanish off the earth and from under heaven]],
\v 12
\q1 who by his power made the earth,
\q2 who by his wisdom founded the world,
\q2 and by his knowledge spread heaven out;
\v 13
\q1 when he thunders, the heavens are in tumult,
\q2 he makes mists rise from the ends of the earth,
\q1 he flashes lightning through the rain,
\q2 and brings wind from his storehouses.
\v 14
\q1 It strikes man dumb and senseless;
\q2 the goldsmith is ashamed of his carved image,
\q1 his metal image is a futile thing.
\v 15
\q1 There is no breath of life in idols;
\q2 they are a vain delusion,
\q2 they break down when the test arrives--
\v 16
\q1 not like him who is Jacob’s own possession;
\q2 for he who formed the universe is Jacob’s God,

\v 23 A word from the Eternal: A wise man must not glory in his wisdom, nor a warrior in his strength, nor the rich man in his riches;
\v 24 he who glories is to glory in this, that he has insight into me, that he knows I am the Eternal, dealing in kindness, justice, and goodness upon earth-- for these are my delight.

\v 1 This message came to Jeremiah from the Eternal,
\v 2 “Speak to the men of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem,
\v 3 tell them that this is the word of the Eternal, the God of Israel: ‘Listen to the terms of this compact --a curse on the man who will not listen!--
\v 4 this compact which I enjoined upon your fathers when I brought them out of that iron furnace, the land of Egypt; I told you, if you obeyed my orders and carried out all my commands, then you would be my people, and I would be a God to you,
\v 5 confirming the oath I swore to your fathers, when I promised them a land abounding in milk and honey--as you have to-day.’ ” I answered the Eternal that I would certainly proclaim this.
\v 6 Then the Eternal bade me proclaim all this in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem saying, “Listen to the terms of this compact, and obey them.”
\v 8 But they did not obey them.
\p
\v 9 The Eternal then said to me, “There is mutiny among the men of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem;
\v 10 they have gone back to the iniquities of their ancestors, who would not listen to what I said; they have gone after foreign gods, to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the compact that I made with their fathers.
\v 11 Therefore (the Eternal declares) I am bringing on them disaster that they cannot escape; nor will I listen to them, when they cry to me.
\v 12 The townsmen of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem may go and cry to the gods to whom they sacrifice; but they will be no help to them at all on the day of their disaster.

\q1 “If you have run with men on foot, and they have tired you out,
\q2 then how can you keep up with horses?
\q1 If you take cover in a land of peace,
\q2 then what will you do in the jungle of Jordan?
\v 6
\q1 For even your brothers and your father’s household,
\q2 even they have played you false.
\q1 even they have raised a hue and cry after you;
\q2 for all their smooth words, never trust them.
    * * *
\v 7
\q1 I have forsaken my house,
\q2 my heritage I have abandoned,
\q1 I have given over my dearly beloved
\q2 to the hand of her foes.
\v 8
\q1 My heritage has turned upon me,
\q2 like a lion in the forest;
\q1 she has raised her voice against me--
\q2 so I hate her.
\v 9
\q1 Do I count my heritage a carcase torn by hyenas,
\q2 that the vultures gather round her?
\q1 Go and gather all the wild beasts,
\q2 bring them to devour her.
\v 10
\q1 A host of nomads have destroyed my vineyard,
\q2 and trampled down my lot;
\q1 my delightful lot is made
\q2 a desolate waste.
\v 11
\q1 They have made it desolate,
\q2 desolate, woebegone, to my sorrow;
\q1 the country lies all desolate,
\q2 and no one takes it to heart.
\v 12
\q1 The ravagers roam the very heights on the downs,
\q2 for the Eternal’s sword devours
\q1 the land from end to end,
\q2 till not a creature is secure.”
\p
\v 14 “As for all my evil neighbours, who lay hands upon the heritage which I made over to my people Israel, I will tear them from their land,” says the Eternal, “and I will tear the house of Judah from their hands.
\v 15 But, after I have torn them up, I will relent and have pity on them, and put them back, every man of them on his own property and on his land.
\v 16 Then, if they are careful to learn the ways of my people and how to swear by my name, saying ‘As the Eternal lives!’ (just as once they taught my people here to swear by Baal), they shall be built up among my people;
\v 17 but if any of them will not listen, then I will tear up that nation, uprooting it,” says the Eternal.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 This is what the Eternal said to me: “Go and get a linen waist-cloth, and wrap it round your waist; do not steep it in water.”
\v 2 So I got a waist-cloth, as the Eternal had told me, and I put it on.
\v 3 A second time the Eternal’s word came to me, saying,
\v 4 “Take that waist-cloth you bought, the waist-cloth round your waist, and go away and hide it at Parah in a crevice of the rock.”
\v 5 So I went and buried it at Parah as the Eternal had ordered me.
\v 6 Many days afterwards the Eternal said to me, “Go to Parah and fetch the waist-cloth which I ordered you to bury there.”
\v 7 So I went to Parah and unearthed the waist-cloth from the place where I had buried it. And the waist-cloth was spoiled, quite useless!
\v 8 Then the word of the Eternal came to me saying, “Hereby the Eternal declares:
\v 9 So will I spoil the pride of Judah and the vast pride of Jerusalem.
\v 10 This evil people, who will not listen to my words, who follow their own stubborn mind and go after foreign gods to serve and worship them—they are to become quite useless, like this waist-cloth.
\v 11 For I meant the whole house of Judah and the whole house of Israel to hold fast to me, says the Eternal, close as a waist-cloth round a man’s waist, to be a people for me, a source of renown, of praise and honour to me; but they would not listen to me.
\v 12 You shall give them this word, straight from the Eternal, the God of Israel: ‘Every jar must be filled with wine.’ If they answer, ‘Do we not know that?’
\v 13 then you must tell them straight from the Eternal: ‘I will fill all the dwellers in this land, the kings on David’s throne, priests, prophets, all the citizens of Jerusalem, fill them till they are drunk,
\v 14 and dash them one against another, father and son together (so the Eternal declares); I will have no mercy, I will not spare, I will have no pity, till I destroy them.’ ”

\q1 Listen—it is the Eternal speaking--
\q2 be not too proud to hearken;
\v 16
\q1 do honour to the Eternal, to your God,
\q2 before the darkness falls,
\q1 before your footsteps stumble
\q2 on the twilight hills,
\q1 before the gleam you look for turns
\q2 to dense, dead gloom.
\v 17
\q1 If you will not listen,
\q2 then I must weep in secret for your pride,
\q1 mine eyes streaming with tears,
\q2 for the Eternal’s flock borne off to exile.
\p
\v 18
\q1 Say to the king, say to the queen-mother,

\q1 The towns in the south are hemmed in,

\q1 Judah is all swept away,
\q2 swept into exile.
\v 20
\q1 Jerusalem, lift up your eyes and look,
\q2 see who are on you from the north!
\q1 Where is the flock entrusted to your charge,
\q2 that flock so fair?
\p
\v 21
\q1 What will you say when you feel the sway
\q2 of those you trained as allies?
\q1 Shall not anguish seize you,
\q2 like the throes of a woman in labour?
\p
\v 22
\q1 And if you say to yourself,
\q2 “Why ever has this befallen me--
\q1 it is for a host of sins
\q2 that you are exposed and stripped.
\p
\v 23
\q1 Can a negro change his skin?
\q2 Can a leopard change his spots?
\q1 As soon can you do right,
\q2 so accustomed to do wrong!
\p
\v 24
\q1 I will scatter you like straw,
\q2 driven by a desert wind;
\v 25
\q1 such is the lot I deal to you,
\q2 your destiny,
\q1 because you have forgotten me, says the Eternal,
\q2 and relied on what was false.
\p
\v 26
\q1 I will lift your skirt high
\q1 and expose you naked,
\v 27
\q1 for your adulteries, your lustful cries,
\q2 your vice so foul.
\p
\q1 Yes, on the open hills
\q2 your lewdness have I seen!
\q1 Woe betide you, Jerusalem!
\q2 Will you ever be clean?

\v 1
\q1 What the Eternal said to Jeremiah
\q2 on the drought:--
    A wail goes up from Jerusalem; 2
    Judah is woebegone, the citizens are cowering, they sit in black on the ' ground;
        0 	the nobles send out slaves for
    water,
    but they find none in the res­ervoirs,
    and come back with empty pitchers,
    disappointed and dumb­founded.
        1 	The farmers are aghast,
    for no rain falls; the ploughmen are dismayed and cover their heads.
        2 	When the hind calves in the
    open,
    she deserts her young;
        3 	wild asses stand upon the knolls,
    panting for air, their eyes are glazed, for lack of pasture.
    22 Who can give rain? Some false god of the pagans?
    Can the skies send down showers?
    Is it not thou, Eternal One, our God?
    And so we wait for thee, who doest all.
        4 	Act, 0 Eternal, for thine own
    sake,
    even though our sins accuse us, though many a time we have fallen away, and sinned against thee.
        5 	But, O thou hope of Israel,
    her saviour in an evil plight, why be like a passing stranger, one who stays but for a night?
        6 	Why be like a man asleep,
    who cannot help?
    O thou Eternal, surely thou art still among us, surely we belong to thee; do not forsake us!
        7 	But the Eternal says of this
    people,
    “They love to go astray,
    with no check on their wander- ing.
    The Eternal is disgusted with them;
    he will remember their guilt now
    and punish their sins.”
    So the Eternal said to me, ii “Pray not for this people. I will 12 not listen to their cry, as they fast, and I will not accept the burnt-offerings and cereals that they offer; I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.” “Ah but, O Lord 13 Eternal!” I replied, “the proph­ets tell them that they will never suffer from the sword nor from famine, since thou wilt give them in this place a settled peace.” Then said the Eternal, 14 “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I never sent them, never gave them orders, never spoke to them; what they prophesy to you is a lying vision, a hollow superstition, a decep­tion of their own minds. This 15 therefore is what the Eternal has to say about prophets who prophesy in my name, though I never sent them, who promise there will never be sword or famine in this country: by sword and by famine shall those very prophets perish, while the people to whom they 16 prophesy shall be flung out into the streets of Jerusalem, dead of famine and the sword, with not a soul to bury either them or their wives or their sons or their daughters—for I will pour upon them their own wicked­ness.
    And you shall say to them, 17 Let my tears stream night and day,
    never let them give o’er;
    for my poor folk are broken, wounded sore.
        15 	When I fare into the fields.
    there lie the slain of the sword;
    when I fare into the city, there is the famine raging; prophet and priest crouch on the ground,
    at their wits’ end.”
        16 	Hast thou rejected Judah alto­
    gether?
    Hast thou a loathing for Sion? Why, then, hast thou struck us, past all recovery?
    We looked for peace,
    but no good came;
    for an hour of healing,
    and here is dismay!
        17 	0 thou Eternal, we confess our
    guilt,
    and the sin of our fathers;
    we have sinned against thee—
        18 	ah, abhor us not, for thine
    own sake,
    bring no disgrace upon thy glorious throne, break not thy compact with us, but recall it.
    The Eternal said to me, “Even though Moses and Samuel stood before me, my mind would not turn to this peo­ple; away with them out of my
        0 	sight—begone! And if they ask you, ‘Where are we to go?’ then tell them, this is the Eternal’s answer: ‘To the pestilence—all who are doomed to pestilence; to the sword—all those who are doomed to the sword; to famine —all those who are doomed to famine; and to exile—all who
        1 	are doomed to exile!’ Four sorts of death I will assign them, the Eternal declares: sword to slay, dogs to tear, wild birds to devour, wild beasts to consume.
    And I will make them a horror 4 to all the kingdoms of the world, on account of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did at Jerusalem.
    Yes, who will pity you, Jeru- 5 salem?
    Who will bemoan you?
    Who will ever turn aside to ask for you?
    You rejected me, says the Eter- 6 nal,
    ever rebelling;
    so I put out my hand to crush you—
    I am tired of relenting!
    I winnow them with a sieve, 7 in all their townships;
    I bereave them of their children,
    I destroy my people, for their vile ways; at noonday I bring raiders	8
    upon mothers and their suck­lings,
    suddenly I strike them with anguish and with terror; even a mother of seven sons 9 droops and swoons, her sun sets ere the day is done,
    she is crushed and con­founded.
    Widows? I have made more 8 widows
    than the sands of all the sea;
    and the rest of them I leave 9
    for their foes to cut to pieces.”
    * * *
    Alas, my mother! you have 10 borne me
    to clash and quarrel with all the world!
    I never lent, I never borrowed money,
    and yet all curse me!
    Amen to their curses, O Eternal, 11 if ever I failed to pray to thee for the welfare of my foes, in disaster and distress!
    Am I of iron to withstand them? 12 Can my strength hold out?
        15 	Eternal One, thou knowest me,
    remember me, care for me; take vengeance for me on my persecutors,
    strike instantly in anger; remember, ’tis for thy sake I am taunted
    by creatures who despise thy word.
        16 	But I delight in it, my very soul
    thrills at thy word; for I belong to thee,
        0 	thou Eternal, God of hosts.
        15 	I never joined the jesting band,
        0 	never rioted;
    I sat alone under thy hand, sharing all thine indignation.
        15 	Why, then do I suffer cease­
    lessly,
    why does my wound fester?
    Wilt thou really disappoint me,
    like a stream that runs dry?
        16 	This was the Eternal’s answer: “If you will give up murmuring,
    I will restore you to my service;
    if you will purify yourself from passion’s dross,
    then you shall be my spokes­man.
    Let other men come over to your side,
    but go not over to join them.
        17 	I will make you a rampart of a
    fort
    to resist this people; they shall attack you but not master you,
    for I am with you to succour you;
        18 	I will deliver you from evil men,
    and free you from the clutches of the cruel.”
    daughters born in this place, on the mothers who bore them, and on their fathers in this place: ‘They shall die of the pestilence, 4 with none to wail for them and none to bury them; they shall lie like dung upon the surface of the ground. They shall be con­sumed by the sword and by famine, and their corpses shall be food for wild birds and wild beasts.’ This is the Eternal’s 5 order:
    Never enter a house of mourn­ing,
    never go to lament or bemoan them;
    for I withdraw my goodwill from this people, says the Eternal.
    Throughout the land both high 6 and low shall die and all unburied lie, with none to lament or gash themselves
    or cut their hair for them, with none to press the mourner 7 to take food on their account, with none to hand a cup of comfort
    for a father or a mother’s death.
    Nor shall you enter any house of 8 feasting,
    to eat and drink in company.
    For thus declares the Lord of 9
    hosts,
    the God of Israel:
    Before your eyes and in your day
    I banish from this place the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of bridegroom and of bride.
    Now, when you tell all this to 10 the people, and they ask you, ‘Why has the Eternal decreed all this terrible misery against
    us? What is our crime? What sin have we committed against
        0 	the Eternal, our God?’ then tell them, ‘It is because your fathers forsook me, the Eternal says, because they followed foreign gods, serving them and worshipping them, because they forsook me and did not keep my
        1 	law; and because you have done worse than your fathers, each of you following his own evil, stubborn mind, and refusing to
        2 	listen to me—that is why I expel you from this land to a land that neither you nor your fathers ever knew, where you will have to serve foreign gods day and night, who will show
        7 	you no favour.’ I am sending for many a fisherman, says the Eternal, to capture this people. After that, I will send for many a huntsman, to hunt them out of every mountain and hill and cranny of the rocks.
        8 	For mine eye is on all they do,
    nothing is hidden from me; their guilt does not escape me.
        9 	I will doubly punish their guilt
    and sin,
    for desecrating my land with dead, detestable idols, for filling up my heritage with their abominations.
        13 	So I will let them feel,
    this once I will let them feel, the full force of my power, to teach them that my name
    is the Eternal.”
    *	*	*
        7 	O thou Eternal, my strength, my stronghold, my refuge in the hour of trouble, nations shall come from the ends of the earth to thee, saying, “All the tra­ditions our fathers inherited were
        8 	lies, vain and profitless. Is man to make gods for himself—gods
    that are no gods at all?”
    *	*	*
    “Judah’s sin is printed with "I n a pen of iron,	•
    with a point of adamant,
    plain on the tablets of heart,
    on the very knobs of altars,
    on every spreading tree, upon 2 the heights,
    upon the hills of the open country.
    Your goods and all your treas- 3 ures,
    I will have them seized as spoil,
    in requital for sins done
    within your borders.
    You must part with the heritage 4 I put into your hands,
    and I will make you serve your foes
    in foreign lands;
    for you have kindled my wrath to a flame
    that shall blaze oif and on.”
    This is the Eternal’s word:	5
    A curse on him who relies on man,
    and leans upon mere human
    aid,
    turning his thoughts from the Eternal!
    He is like some desert scrub 6 that never thrives, set in a dry place in the steppes, in a salt, solitary land.
    But happy he who relies on the 7 Eternal,
    with the Eternal for his con­fidence!
    He is like a tree planted beside 8 a stream,
    reaching its roots to the water;
    untouched by any fear of scorch­ing heat,
    its leaves are ever green, it goes on bearing fruit in days of drought, and lives serene.
        11 	[[Like a partridge hatching eggs
    it never laid,
    so is the man who makes money unfairly;
    it leaves him ere his life is over, and in the end he proves him­self a fool.]]
        12 	[[The site of our sanctuary is a glorious throne, exalted from
        13 	the very first. O thou Eternal, Israel’s hope, all who for­sake thee shall be disappointed, those who abandon thee in the land shall be reduced to shame, because they have forsaken the Eternal, the fresh fountain of water.]]
    9 Deep is a man’s mind, deeper than all else, on evil bent; who can fathom it?
    io	“I the Eternal search the mind,
    i I test the heart, rewarding every man as he has lived,
    and as his deeds deserve.”
        14 	Then heal me, 0 Eternal, and I
    shall be healed, save me, and I shall be saved; for it is thou to whom I render praise.
        15 	Men taunt me, crying,
    “Where is the Eternal’s word? Come on with it!”
        16 	Yet never would I press thee
    to bring on calamity;
    I never longed—thou knowest— for a judgment day; all that I ever said, is known to thee.
        17 	So be not thou a terror to me,
    O thou my refuge on the day of evil.
        18 	Terrify my tormentors,
    terrify them, not me; bring on them the day of evil,
    double ruin for them.
    * * *
    This is what the Eternal said 19 to me. “Go and stand at the gate of Benjamin, where the kings of Judah pass in and out, and at all the gates of Jerusa­lem, saying: ‘Listen to the word 20 of the Eternal, you kings of Ju­dah, all you men of Judah, and all citizens of Jerusalem who enter by these gates. This is 21 what the Eternal says: For the 22 sake of your fives, never carry a load on the sabbath, or bring anything in through the gates of Jerusalem; never carry any load out of your houses on the sabbath, nor do any work, but keep the sabbath sacred, as I ordered your fathers—though 23 they would not listen, they would not lend an ear, but obstinately refused to listen and take warning. But if you 24 attend to me carefully, says the Eternal, and bring in no load through the gates of this city on the sabbath, if you keep the sabbath sacred by doing no work, then kings of David’s 25 dynasty, riding in chariots and on horses, with the men of Ju­dah and the citizens of Jerusa­lem, shall pass the gates of this city, and this city shall always be inhabited; men shall come 26 from the towns of Judah and the districts round Jerusalem and the land of Benjamin and the lowlands and the highlands and the south, bringing burnt- offerings and sacrifices and cereal-offerings and incense and thank-offerings to the house of the Eternal. But if you will not 27 listen to me, as I bid you keep the sabbath sacred and forbid you to carry in loads through the gates of Jerusalem on the sab­bath, then I will fight a fire in the city-gates that will burn up
    the buildings of Jerusalem and never be put out.’ ”
    This message came to Jere­miah from the Eternal:
        0 	“Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will let you hear
        1 	what I have to say.” So I went down to the potter’s house. He
        2 	was at work with his wheel; and whenever any vessel he was making got spoiled in his hands, he re-moulded it to please him­self, till he was satisfied.
        3 	Then the Eternal’s word came to
        4 	me, “0 house of Israel, cannot I do to you as this potter does? Why, as the clay in the potter’s hands, so you are in my hands.
        5 	[[At one time I may speak of tearing up a nation or kingdom, breaking it down and destroying
        6 	it; but if that nation turns from its evil, I will change my mind about the evil that I thought
        7 	of inflicting upon it. Again, I may speak of building up a nation or kingdom, of planting
        8 	it; but if that nation does evil in my sight by refusing to listen to my voice, then I will change my mind about the benefits which I meant to bestow upon it.
        9 	So give the men of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem this message from the Eternal: T am shaping a calamity for you and devising a plan against you; ah, turn every one of you from your evil courses, amend your
        10 	life and work!’ They will say, ‘It is no use to talk; we mean to live as we choose, and follow, every man of us, our own evil, stubborn minds.’]]”
        11 	This is what the Eternal says: “Inquire among the nations
    if the like of this was ever heard,
    the awful, the appalling thing that maiden Israel has done?
    Does hoar-frost ever leave 14 mount Sirion, or snow Lebanon?
    Do cold streams from the hills ever run dry?
    And yet my people have for- 15 gotten me,
    and sacrificed to no-gods!
    So they stumble as they pass along the old path, and then take to bypaths of their own,
    badly made;
    till their country goes to ruin, 16 a scorn and horror for all time, at which the passer-by is shocked
    and openly derides.
    Like a sirocco will I scatter 17 them
    in flight before their foe; my back and not my face I turn to them,
    upon their day of woe.”
    * * *
    “Come on,” they said, “let us 18 contrive a plot against	Jere­
    miah; we shall not fail to get advice about it from the priests, or counsel from the sages, or some inspiration from	the
    prophets. Come on, let us undermine him with some slan­der; let us note any word he utters.”
    Note them, 0 Eternal,	19
    listen to my foes!
    Is good to be repaid by evil? 20 They have dug a pit to take my life,
    men for whom once (remember)
    I made intercession, pleading in thy presence to avert thy wrath from them! Leave their children to fall by 21 famine,
    throw them to the sword!
    May their wives be childless and widows,
    their men die by the pestilence,
    their young men be slain in war!
        21 	Let shrieks rise from their
    homes,
    when suddenly thou bringest on them the raiders!
    For they have dug a pit to cap­ture me,
    and hidden traps to catch my feet.
        22 	But, O Eternal, well thou
    knowest
    all their murderous moves against me;
    never pardon their iniquity,
    never blot out their sin; trip them till they crash before thee,
    deal with them in thy day of anger!
    The Eternal said to me, “Go and get a potter’s jar of clay; get some of the leading laymen and some of the priests,
        2 	and go out to the valley belong­ing to Ben-Hinnom, close to the entry of the Potsherd Gate; there announce the message I
        3 	give you, saying, ‘Listen to the word of the Eternal, O kings of Judah and citizens of Jeru­salem. This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am bringing a disaster on this city, that will make the ears of
        4 	every hearer ring; because the people have forsaken me and desecrated this valley by sacri­ficing here to foreign gods, which neither they nor their fathers ever knew; kings of Judah have drenched this valley with inno-
        5 	cent blood, erecting shrines to Baal for burning alive their children as a sacrifice to Baal— a thing I never ordered, never mentioned, a thing that never
        6 	entered my mind! So the day will come, the Eternal declares, when its name shall no longer be
    Topheth, or The valley be­longing to Ben-Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter; I will 7 empty out here this jar full of plans made by Judah and Jerusa­lem; I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies and die by the hand of murderous pursuers, leaving their corpses as food for the wild birds and wild beasts; I will make this 8 city a desolation and a scorn, so that any passer-by shall whistle in surprise and horror at all my crushing blows; I will make the 9 citizens eat the flesh of their own sons and daughters, and every man shall eat the flesh of his fellow, in the siege and straits by which their enemies and murderous pursuers hem them in.’ Then you must break io the jar in presence of the men who have accompanied you, giving them this message from ii the Lord of hosts: ‘I will break this people and this city just as one breaks a potter’s jar, so that it cannot be repaired. That is how I will treat this city 12 and its citizens, says the Eter­nal. I will desecrate this city 13 like Topheth, and make the house of Jerusalem and of the kings of Judah as unclean as Topheth, all the houses on whose roofs sacrifice was offered to the starry host and libations poured out in honour of foreign gods.’ ”
    Then Jeremiah left Topheth, 14 where the Eternal had sent him to prophesy, and stood inside the court of the Eter­nal’s house, where he told the people, “This is what the 15 Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I am bringing on the city and on all her townships the full evil that I threatened; for they
    have obstinately refused to listen to my words.’ ”
    Now when Pashhur, the son of the priest Immer, who was in charge of the Eter­nal’s house, heard Jeremiah mak-
        2 	ing this prophecy, Pashhur struck the prophet Jeremiah and put him in the stocks at the up­per Gate of Benjamin, beside the
        3 	house of the Eternal. Next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The Eternal’s name for you is not Pashhur but Terror;
        4 	for this is what the Eternal says, ‘I will make you a terror both to yourself and to all your friends; they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, while you look on. I will hand over all Judah to the king of Baby­lon, to be carried off in exile to Babylon and slain by the
        5 	sword; moreover, I will hand over all the wealth of this city and all its possessions, all the treasures of the kings of Judah, to their enemies, who shall rifle and seize them and bear them
        6 	off to Babylon. And as for you and your household, Pashhur, you shall be exiled; you shall go to Babylon and die there and be buried there, you and all the friends to whom you have been
    a false prophet.’ ”

    when I was born, unblessed the day my mother bore me!
        1 	Cursed be the man
    who told my father, crying, “A son is born to you!” and giving him joy.

    May he hear shrieks at dawn,
    and the battle-cry at noon, because he did not stifle me in 17 the womb!
    Then would my mother have been my tomb,
    and her womb ever big with me.
    Why did I ever leave the womb, 18 only for toil and trouble, only to wear out my life with shame P
    Eternal One, thou didst per- 7 suade me,
    and I let myself be persuaded! Thou wast too strong for me;
    I had to yield.
    Now all day long I am a laugh­ing-stock; men all deride me.
    Whenever I speak, they mock, 8 and they ill-treat me; for uttering the Eternal’s word day after day,
    I am taunted and insulted.
    If I say, “I will not mention it, 9 I will not speak in his name any more,”
    then I feel within me as it were a fire that burns my very being.
    I am tired of this, so tired I cannot bear it any longer;
    at every turn I am in terror, 10 for I hear many whispering, “Denounce him! let us denounce him!”
    My very friends are on the watch for a false step; “Perhaps,” they whisper, “he will make a slip; and then we have him, then for our revenge!”
    Ah, but I have the Eternal on 11 my side,
    a dread and doughty cham­pion!
    My persecutors shall collapse and miss their aim; bitter shall be their shame
    over their failure, a lasting shame to them,
    never to be forgotten.

    The message that came from the Eternal to Jere­miah, when king Zedekiah sent Pashhur the son of Malchiah and Zephanlah the priest, the son of
        2 	Maaseiah, to ask him, “Pray consult the Eternal on our be­half, for Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon is making war on us; perhaps the Eternal will work a miracle for us, as he has often done, and force the man to
        3 	retreat.” But Jeremiah said to
        4 	them, “Tell Zedekiah that this is the reply of the Eternal, the God of Israel: ‘The weapons you are using to fight the king of Babylon and your Chaldean be­siegers outside the city, I will render useless, forcing you back
        5 	inside the city, where I myself will fight you with might and main, in anger, fury, and fierce
        6 	wrath; I will strike down the citizens of this city, and beasts as well as men shall die of a great
        7 	pestilence. Then (the Eternal de­clares) Zedekiah king of Judah, with his officers, and with any citizens who survive the pesti­lence, the sword, and the famine, I will hand over to the enemy and to those who would destroy them, till they are killed with­out quarter, without pity, not
        8 	one spared.’ ” “Also,” said the Eternal, “tell this people that the Eternal’s message is: ‘Here I put before you the way of life and the way of death;
        9 	anyone who stays in the city shall die by the sword, by fam­ine, or by pestilence; but any­one who leaves and surrenders to your Chaldean besiegers shall live, he shall escape with his
    io	life. For I have determined
    evil and not good for this city; it shall be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it up. And as many nn a nation passes this city, every man shall ask his fellow, 8 ‘Why has the Eternal done this to yon great city?’ And the an- 9 swer will be, ‘Because they gave up their compact with the Eter­nal their God and worshipped foreign gods and served them.’ ”

This is the 3 Eternal’s order: ‘Govern justly and fairly, rescue the victims of oppression, never wrong nor ill- treat a resident alien, an orphan, or a widow, and never shed inno­cent blood in this place. If you 4 carry out this loyally, then kings of David’s dynasty, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officers and people shall pass these palace gates.

    has to say about the court of the king of Judah:
    ‘Though you were a flourishing Gilead of growth for me, a thick-sown crest of Lebanon, I will reduce you to a desert, like a town untenanted;

        4 	come back again; he shall die in the land where they have car­ried him into exile; he shall never see this land again.”)
        5 	Woe to him who builds his
    palace on injustice, his chambers upon fraud, who forces other men to work for nothing,
    holding back their wages,
        6 	who thinks to build himself a

    as men lament a brother or a sister;
    there shall be no lamenting for him—

    Woe to rulers who ruin and scatter
    the flock that was theirs to shepherd!
    a This therefore is the Eternal’s sentence
    on the rulers in charge of his flock:
    “You scattered my flock and drove them away, you took no care of them; so I will take good care to punish you
    for the evil you have done.
    3 I will gather all that is left of my flock

    to reign both royally and ably, to enforce law and justice in the land;
    under him Judah shall be safe, 6 and Israel live secure, and this shall be his title,

    On the prophets;—	9
    My heart is broken within me,
    my limbs are all relaxed,
    I feel like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, at the thought of the Eternal and his glorious majesty!
    For the land is full of faithless 10 men,
    running an evil course, with might that is not right. Prophet and priest are alike n profane;
    and, says the Eternal, “even inside my fane I come upon their crimes. Therefore their path shall prove 12 to them
    a slippery place,
    they shall be driven along it in the dark
    to their downfall; for I will bring disaster upon them,
    in their year of doom.
        11 	Sickening things have I seen
    in Samaria’s prophets; they prophesied by Baal, and misled my people Israel.
        12 	But horrible things have I seen
    in the prophets of Jerusalem; they are adulterers, they lie, they abet evildoers, till not a soul will repent; they are all as bad as Sodom, and the citizens bad as Go­morrah.”
        13 	This therefore is the sentence of the Lord of hosts upon the prophets:
    “I will feed them with bitter wormwood,
    and give them poisonous drugs;
    for the prophets of Jerusalem have spread profanity over the whole land.”
        14 	This is the warning of the Lord
    of hosts:
    “Never listen to what the prophets say;
    they fill you up with idle hopes, they tell you fancies of their own,
    not anything the Eternal says;
        15 	‘All will be well,’ they repeat,
    to people who scorn what the Eternal says;
    ‘No harm will come to you,’ they tell
    the folk who follow their own stubborn minds.
        16 	Which of these prophets ever
    saw
    the council of the Eternal? Which of them ever heard or grasped a word of his?
        7 	I never sent the prophets, yet they ran;
    I never spoke to them, and yet they prophesied.
    If they had ever stood within 23 my council,
    and heard a word of mine, they would have made my peo­ple turn
    from evil ways and evil deeds. Am I a God at hand,	23
    and not a God far off?
    Can any man conceal himself 24 out of my sight?
    Do not I fill heaven and earth?— the Eternal asks.
    I have heard what the prophets 25 say,
    who prophesy falsely in my name—
    ‘I’ve had a dream,’ they cry,
    ‘I’ve had a dream!’
    Will they never give over,	26
    these prophets of falsehood, who preach their own illusions, and would make my folk for- 27 get my name,
    by the dreams they tell each other,
    as once their fathers forgot me for Baal?
    If a prophet has had a dream, 28 then let him tell his dream; but he who has a word of mine, then let him tell it faithfully. Why mix straw with wheat?— the Eternal asks.
    Is not my word like fire,	29
    like a hammer that shatters stone?
    Well then, the Eternal de- 30 clares, I am against prophets who pick up my words, each from his fellow. I am against 31 prophets who mouth the proph­ets’ formula about what ‘the Eternal says.’ I am against 32 prophets who recount lying dreams, leading my people astray with their lies and their empty pretensions, though I never sent them, never com­missioned them; they are no help whatever to tins people, says the Eternal. When a lay- 33
    man or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the Eternal’s oracle?’ tell them this from the Eternal: ‘Burden! you are the burden, and I mean to throw you off.
        21 	Any prophet or priest or lay­man who talks of “the Eter­nal’s oracle” or of “what the Eternal says,” I will punish that man and his household.
        22 	No, this is what every man of you must say to his fellow, to his brother: “What is the Eter­nal’s answer?” “What is the
        23 	Eternal’s message?” You must never again mention the Eter-
        36 	nal’s “burden.” (A man’s own word shall be the “burden” of his oracle!) If you dare to men­tion “the burden of the Eter­nal’s oracle,” though I have ex­pressly told you never to men-
        37 	tion it, then, the Eternal declares, I will lift you like a burden and throw you away, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers, far
        38 	away from me, and I will cover you with a lasting reproach and an unending disgrace, never to be forgotten.’ ”
    It was after Nebuchadrez­zar king of Babylon had carried off to exile at Babylon Jekonlah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the leading men of Judah, with the crafts­men and the joiners of Jeru­salem, that the Eternal gave me a vision of two baskets of figs, placed in front of the Eternal’s
        0 	temple. One basket had very fine figs, as fine as first-ripe figs. The other basket had very poor figs, so poor that they were un-
        1 	eatable. The Eternal said to me, “What do you see, Jere­miah?” “Figs,” I answered, “the fine figs very fine, the poor figs
    very poor, so poor that they are uneatable.” Then the Eter- 4 nal’s word came to me: “This is 5 what the Eternal, the God of Is­rael, says: so will I favour, like these fine figs, the exiles from Judah whom I have deported to the land of the Chaldeans; I will 6 look to their welfare, I will bring them back to this land, I will build them up, in­stead of pulling them down, I will plant them, instead of pulling them up; I will give 7 them a heart to understand that I am the Eternal, and they shall be my people, I will be a God to them, when they return to me with all their heart. As 8 for the poor figs, so poor that they are uneatable—that is how I will treat Zedekiah king of Judah, with his leading men, and the survivors of Jerusalem who are left in this land, and those who reside in the land of Egypt; I will make them an 9 object of disgust to every king­dom in the world, a derision, a byword, a taunt, and a curse, wherever I drive them; also, I 10 will send the sword, famine, and pestilence among them, till they are consumed out of the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.”
    The word that came to ey Jeremiah regarding all the “ people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Jo- siah, king of Judah (the first year of Nebuchadrezzar kingof Baby­lon), the message he delivered 2 to all the people of Judah and all the citizens of Jerusalem. “[[For all these twenty-three 3 years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, down to this day, I have been telling you, earnestly
        5 	and urgently, to give up your evil courses, every one of you, and your evil conduct, that you may remain in the land that the Eternal gave to you and to
        6 	your fathers for all time, in­stead of wandering away to serve and worship foreign gods, angering the Eternal with your manufactured idols—only to
        7 	your own hurt. But you would
        8 	not listen to me. This there­fore is the sentence of the Lord of hosts: Since you have not
        9 	listened to my words,]] I am sending for a race from the north and bringing it down upon this land, upon its in­habitants and upon all the sur­rounding nations. I will ex­terminate them, I will make them a lasting desolation, a
    io	scorn and horror; I will banish from them the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the bride, the sound of millstones and the
    xi light of a lamp. The whole of this country shall be a waste and a horror [[and for seventy years the people shall be sub­ject to the king of Babylon.
        12 	However, when the seventy years are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation for their guilt, says the Eternal, and I will make the land of the Chaldeans desolate
        13 	for all time. I will inflict on that land all the threats I have uttered against it, all the threats which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations, and which are written in this book.
        14 	Many a nation, many a great king, shall make slaves of them, yes even of them; but I will pay them back for what they have
        15 	done, as they deserve]],” For this is what the Eternal, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take
    this wine-cup of wrath that I hand to you, and hold it to the lips of all the nations to whom I send you, till they drink it 16 and stagger madly to and fro.” [[So I took the cup from 17 the hand of the Eternal and held it to the lips of all the nations to whom the Eternal had sent me—to Jerusalem, to 18 Judah with its towns, its kings and leading men (to render them a desolation, a horror, a derision, and a curse, as at the present day), to the Pharaoh, 19 king of Egypt, his courtiers, princes, all his people and 20 all the foreign population of Egypt, to all the kings of the land of Uz, to all the kings of the land of the Philistines—that is, of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the survivors in Ashdod, to 21 Edom, Moab, and the Am­monites, to all the kings of 22 Tyre and of Sidon, to the kings of the coast-land over­seas, to Dedan, Tema, Buz, and 23 all the crop-haired clans, to all 24 the nomad kings, to all the 25 kings of Zimri, Elam, and Me­dia, to all the kings of the 26 north, far and near, one after another, to all kingdoms on the face of the earth; and after them the king of Babylon shall drink.]] “Tell them this is what the Lord 27 of hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Drink yourselves drunk, till you tumble in your vomit, never to rise again—under the sword I am sending among you.’ And if 28 they decline to drink the cup you hand to them, tell them this is what the Lord of hosts says: ‘Drink you must!

    so fierce the Eternal’s fury!
    The very lions leave their lairs, 38
    for the land now lies a desert under the stress of the sword,
    the furious wrath of the Eter­nal.
    At the beginning of the eyfi reign of Jehoiakim the son “O of Josiah, king of Judah, this message came from the Eternal. “Here is what the Eternal says: 2 Stand in the court of the Eter­nal’s temple, and as all the citi­zens of Judah come to worship in the Eternal’s temple, tell them all the words that I order you to utter. Do not keep back a sin­gle word; perhaps they will listen 3 and turn, each man, from his evil course, so that I may relent and withhold the evil which I plan to inflict upon them for their evil deeds. Tell them that 4 this is the Eternal’s message:
    ‘If you will not listen to me, if you will not follow the direc­tions that I put before you, if 5 you will not listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you eagerly and earnestly (though you have not listened to them), then I will 6 lay this temple low like Shilo, and make this city a byword for the curses of every nation upon earth.’ ”
    Now the priests and the 7 prophets, as well as all the peo­ple, heard Jeremiah saying this in the Eternal’s temple. So when 8 Jeremiah had finished saying all that the Eternal had ordered him to say to all the people, the priests and the prophets seized him. “You shall die,” they said; “what do you mean by prophe- 9 sying in the Eternal’s name that this temple shall become like Shilo and that this city is to be desolate and untenanted?”
    The people were all swarming
    round Jeremiah in the Eternal’s
        5 	temple; and when the authorities of Judah learned this, they came up to the Eternal’s temple from the royal palace, and seated themselves at the entrance of the new gate into the Eternal’s
        6 	temple. Then the priests and the prophets said to the au­thorities and to all the people, “This fellow deserves to die; he has been prophesying against this city—you have heard him
        7 	with your own ears!” But Jere­miah said to the authorities and to all the people, “It was the Eternal who sent me to proph­esy against this temple and this city every word you have just
        8 	heard. Now then, amend your ways and deeds, obey the voice of the Eternal your God, and the Eternal will relent, he will withhold the evil he has pro-
        9 	nounced against you. As for myself, I am in your power; you can do with me as you
        10 	think right and good. Only, be sure of this, that if you put me to death, you bring the guilt of innocent blood upon yourselves and this city and its citizens; for it is a fact that the Eternal did send me to say all this in your hearing.”
        11 	The authorities and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve to die; he has been speaking to us in the name of
        12 	the Eternal our God.” Some of the older inhabitants also rose to their feet and said to all the
        13 	popular assembly, “When Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign of Hezekiah king of Judah, he told all the people of Judah that this was the word of the Lord of hosts:
    Sion shall be ploughed up like a field,
    Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins,
    the temple-hill a mere wooded height.
    Did king Hezekiah or the peo- 19 pie of Judah ever put him to death? Did they not reverently appease the Eternal, till the Eternal relented and withheld the evil he had pronounced against them? But as for us, we are about to wreak evil on ourselves!”
    (There was another man who 20 prophesied in the name of the Eternal, Uriah the son of She- maiah, belonging to Kiriath- jearim; he too prophesied against this city and this land, just as Jeremiah did. When 21 king Jehoiakim and all the au­thorities heard what he said, the king tried to murder him; but Uriah heard of it and fled in fear, away to Egypt. So 22 king Jehoiakim sent El-nathan the son of Achbor, with some others, to Egypt; they brought 23 Uriah from Egypt to king Je­hoiakim, who had him slain with the sword and his body flung into the public grave.)
    Ahikam the son of Shaphan, 24 however, came to the help of Jeremiah, and prevented him from being handed over to the people and killed.
    At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of “ • Josiah, king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year of his reign, this message came from the Eternal to Jeremiah. “The 3 Eternal’s order to Jeremiah: Make a yoke of thongs and bars and put it on your neck; then send a message to the 3 kings of Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites, to the king of Tyre and to the king of Sidon, by
    the messengers who have come from them to Zedekiah, king of
        4 	Judah, at Jerusalem. Bid them tell their masters this. ‘Here is .what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Tell your mas-
        5 	ters that it is I who made the earth, with all the men and beasts upon the surface of the earth, by my great power and outstretched arm. I give it to
        6 	anyone whom I choose. I have now given all these lands into the hand of my servant Nebu­chadrezzar, king of Babylon; I have given him even the wild
        7 	beasts for his service. [[All nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, till the time comes round for his own land; and then many a nation and many a great king shall
        8 	make him a slave.]] Any na­tion or kingdom that will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation, says the Eternal, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, till I bring it under his sway.
        9 	Pay you no heed to your proph­ets and seers and dreamers and soothsayers and sorcerers, who tell you that you will not be subject to the king of Babylon.
        10 	It is a lie that they prophesy to you—it will only banish you
        11 	far from your land. Whereas any nation that puts its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him, I will let that nation stay on in its own land, says the Eternal; they shall till the land and live in it.”’
        12 	Jeremiah gave the very same message to Zedekiah, king of Judah. “Put your neck under the yoke of the king of Baby­lon,” he said; “serve him and his people, and you shall live.
    Why should you and your peo- 13 pie die by the sword and the famine and the pestilence with which the Eternal has threat­ened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? Never heed what the prophets 14 say, when they tell you not to be subject to the king of Baby­lon. It is a lie that they prophesy to you. I never sent 15 them, says the Eternal, yet they prophesy falsely in my name; it will only end in your being driven out to perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”
    To the priests and all the 16 people Jeremiah also spoke as follows: “This is the Eternal’s order: never heed what your prophets say when they tell you that the vessels of the Eternal’s temple are soon to be brought back from Babylon. It is a lie 17 that they are prophesying to you. If they are really prophets, 18 if they have the Eternal’s word, let them plead with the Lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the temple of the Eternal and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem, may not be taken to Babylon. As for 19 [[the columns and the tank and the pedestals and]] the rest of the vessels left in this city, which Nebuchadrezzar the king 20 of Babylon did not remove when he bore off to exile Jekomah [[the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah]] from Jerusalem [[to Babylon, with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem]], this is 21 what the Lord [[of hosts, the God of Israel,]] says [[with re­gard to the vessels that remain in the temple of the Eternal, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem]]: ‘They shall 22 be taken to Babylon [[and re-
    main there till the day I re­member them]], says the Eter- nal[[; then I will bring them up and restore them to this place]].’”
    Hananlah the prophet, the son of Azzur, a Gibeonite, declared to me in presence of the priests and of all the people in the temple of the Eternal,
        2 	“This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of
        3 	Babylon; within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the Eternal’s tem­ple that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon took away from this
        4 	place to Babylon; I will also bring back to this place Jeko- niah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the exiles of Judah who have gone to Baby­lon, says the Eternal; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon!’ ”
        5 	Then the prophet Jeremiah addressed the prophet Han­anlah in presence of the priests and of all the people who were standing in the temple
        6 	of the Eternal. “Amen,” said the prophet Jeremiah, “may the Eternal do so! May the Eter­nal fulfil your prophecy, by bringing back the vessels of the Eternal’s temple and all the exiles from Babylon to this
        7 	place! Only, I would have you listen to what I am going to say in your hearing and in the
        8 	hearing of all the people. The prophets of old, who lived be­fore me and before you, prophe­sied war when they prophesied against many countries and
        9 	great kingdoms. When a prophet prophesies peace, it is only after his word comes true that he is known to have been really sent by the Eternal.”
    Then the prophet Hananlah io taking the yoke from the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, broke it and declared in presence of n all the people, “This is the Eternal’s word: ‘Thus will I break the yoke of the king of Babylon off the necks of all the nations.’” The prophet Jere­miah went away.
    It was after the prophet Han- 12 amah had broken the yoke from the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, that this message came from the Eternal to Jeremiah: “Go and 13 tell Hananlah that this is the Eternal’s message: ‘The wooden yoke you have broken, but I will replace it with an iron yoke. For this is what the 14 Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: It will be an iron yoke that I lay on the necks of all these nations, a yoke of slavery to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; serve him they shall.’” Then said the prophet 15 Jeremiah to the prophet Han­anlah, “Listen, Hananlah! The Eternal never sent you; you are making this people rely on what is false. Therefore the Eternal’s 16 sentence is: ‘I will send you— off the face of the earth! This very year you are to die, for having taught disloyalty to the Eternal.’ ” And that very year, 17 in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah did die.
    Here are the terms of the nn letter sent from Jerusalem by the prophet Jeremiah to the sheikhs in exile, to the priests, the prophets, and afl the laity who had been carried off from Jerusalem to exile at Babylon by Nebuchadrezzar (this was after 2 the surrender of king JekonTah and the queen-mother, the eunuchs, the authorities of Judah
    and Jerusalem, the craftsmen,
        3 	and the joiners). The letter was conveyed by Eleasah the son of Shaphan, and by Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, who were sent on a mission to Babylon by Zedekiah king of Judah, to Nebuchadrezzar king of Baby-
        4 	Ion. “This is the message of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have deported from Jerusalem
        5 	to Babylon: ‘Build houses and live in them, plant gardens and
        6 	eat their produce, marry wives and bring up families, get wives for your sons and hus­bands for your daughters, and multiply where you are—never
        7 	let your numbers diminish. Do your best for the welfare of the country where I have sent you to be exiles; pray to the Eternal for it, since your welfare lies in
        8 	its welfare.’ This is the mes­sage of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Never let your­selves be deceived by the proph­ets and the seers among you,
        9 	never listen to their dreams; for they are prophesying falsely to you in my name—-I never sent
        10 	them,’ says the Eternal. This is what the Eternal says: ‘As soon as Babylon’s seventy years are over, I will visit you and carry out my promise to you,
        11 	by bringing you back here. For I keep in mind my purpose for you, a purpose of weal, not of woe, to let you have hope for
        12 	the future; pray to me, and I
        13 	will answer you; seek me, and you shall find me; when you seek for me with all your heart,
        14 	I will reveal myself to you,’ says the Eternal. [[And I will restore your fortunes and col­lect you from all the nations and countries where I have de­ported you, says the Eternal,
    and bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.]] [[For this is the Eter- 16 nal’s sentence on the king who is seated upon David’s throne and on all the people staying in this city—those kinsfolk of yours who have not accom­panied you into exile. This is 17 what the Lord of hosts says: I will send the sword, famine, and pestilence among them, and make them like horrible figs, so bad that they are uneatable; I 18 will hunt them down with sword, famine, and pestilence, and turn them into a horror among all the kingdoms of the world, to be execrated and stared at and hissed and de­rided among all the nations wherever I deport them, be- 19 cause they would not listen to wdiat I said (the Eternal de­clares), to the words I sent them earnestly and urgently by my servants the prophets—but listen they would not, says the Eternal! So listen you to what 20 the Eternal says, all you exiles whom I have sent from Jerusa­lem to Babylon.]] But, you 15 say, we have prophets of our own from the Eternal in Babylon? Well, here is what the Lord of 21 hosts, the God of Israel, has to say about Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophe­sying falsely to you in my name: ‘I will hand them over to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, to be slain before your eyes; and when any of 22 the exiles of Judah in Babylon curse, it will be in terms of their doom, saying, “The Eter­nal treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Baby­lon roasted alive in the fire!”
    —for behaving impiously in Is- 23
    rael, debauching the wives of other men, and speaking falsely in my name, without any au­thority from me. I know it, the Eternal declares, I witnessed it.’ ”
        24 	Shemaiah of Nehelam also
        25 	sent a letter on his own account to Zephamah the priest, the
        26 	son of Maaseiah. “The Eter­nal,” he wrote, “has made you priest in place of Jehoiada, to take charge of the Eternal’s temple, and you ought to put every madman who poses as a prophet into the stocks and the
        27 	iron collar. Why then have you not reprimanded Jeremiah of Anathoth? He has been pos-
        28 	ing to you as a prophet. He has sent word to me in Babylon that ‘the exile will be long,’ and that we are to ‘build houses and live in them, and plant gar­dens and eat their produce.’”
        29 	The priest Zephamah read this
        30 	letter to Jeremiah. Then this word of the Eternal came to
        31 	Jeremiah: “Send all the exiles this sentence of the Eternal upon Shemaiah of Nehelam. ‘Since Shemaiah has been prophesying to you, although I never sent him, and since he has led you to believe in a lie,
        32 	therefore (the Eternal declares) I will punish Shemaiah and his descendants; he shall have no descendant among you who lives to see the happiness I am about to bring to my people (says the Eternal), for he has spoken disloyally against the Eternal.’ ”
    A message that came from the Eternal to Jeremiah.
        2 	“These are the orders of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Write down in a book every
        3 	word I have spoken to you, for the day is coming, the Eternal
    declares, when I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel and Judah, and bring them back to possess the land that I gave to their fathers.”
    Here are the words spoken by 4 the Eternal with regard to Is­rael and Judah:
    Wre have heard a scream of ter- 5 tot;
    all is alarm and unrest.
    Ask now and inquire,	6
    if a man is ever with child; for why do I see every man pressing his hands on his loins,
    and why is every face turned to a deadly pallor?
    Ah, this is an awful Day!	7
    what day is like it?— an hour of anguish for Jacob; but he shall come through it.
    “For on this Day, says the 8 Lord of hosts,
    I will break the yoke from their neck,
    and snap their thongs; they shall serve foreigners no 9 more,
    but serve their God, the Eternal,
    and their Davidic king, whom I will raise up for them.
    [[Fear not then, my servant 10 Jacob,
    0 Israel, be not dismayed;
    I will bring you safe from afar, and your race from the land of their exile;
    Jacob again shall have quiet and ease,
    with none to disturb him.
    For I am with you, the Eternal n promises, to succour you;
    I will put an end to all the na­tions,
    where I scattered you, but I will not put an end to you;
    I will chastise you, but not too hard,
    though I must punish you.]]”
        12 	For this is the Eternal’s word: “Your hurt is beyond healing,
    your wound is sore;
        13 	there is none to bandage you,
    no salve for your bruise;
        14 	all your allies have forgotten you,
    they care nothing for you;
    I wounded you as a foe wounds, with cruel punishment.
        15 	Why wail over your hurt,
    that your pain is past all healing?
    I did it all to you for your guilt profound, for your sins that so abound.
        16 	Yet all who devour you shall
    be devoured,
    your foes shall all be exiled, those who despoil you shall themselves be spoiled, your plunderers—I will have them plundered.
        17 	For I will give you health again,
    and heal your wounds, the Eternal promises— you whom the hunters called an outcast,
    ‘Our quarry! No one cares for her!’ ”
        18 	This is the Eternal’s word: “Jacob’s exiles I will restore,
    I will take pity on his homes; towns shall be built on their own sites,
    and buildings stand where once they stood;
        19 	from them shall chants of praise
    resound,
    the songs of folk delighted.
    I will increase them, and they shall abound,
    they shall be honoured and
    not slighted;
        20 	their sons shall thrive as in the
    days of old,
    and I will care for their com­munity,
    punishing any who oppress them.
    Their prince shall be one of 21 themselves,
    their ruler shall be native- born;
    I will grant him access to my­self,
    and he shall enter my pres­ence—
    for how else could one dare to enter my presence?” says the Eternal.
    [[Here is the Eternal’s storm of 23 fury, _
    a sweeping cyclone,
    bursting on sinful heads!
    Till he has done what he de- 24 signed,
    till he has carried out his mind,
    the Eternal calls not back his anger fierce—
    as, at the consummation, you shall find.]]
    “Then,” the Eternal prom- o "|
    ises,
    “I will be God to all the fam­ilies of Israel,
    and they shall be my people.” For this is the Eternal’s promise: “Those who survive the sword
    shall find grace in the dun­geon.”
    When Israel yearned for rest, then in a far land the Eternal appeared,
    saying, “From of old I love you, so now I draw you gently home.
    Once more I will settle you, 4 O maiden Israel; once more you shall take the tambourine and dance merrily;
        5 	once more you shall plant vines
    upon Samaria’s slopes, and those who plant shall enjoy the grapes,
    with praise to the Eternal.”
        6 	[[Yes, the day will come when
    vintagers
    on the heights of Ephraim cry, “Let us rise and go to Sion, to the Eternal, our own God!”]]
        7 	For this is the Eternal’s word
    to Jacob:
    “Shout aloud on the hill-tops, ring out your praises, cry, ‘The Eternal has saved his peo­ple,
    the remnant of Israel!’
        8 	I am bringing them out of the
    north-land,
    gathering them from the ends of the earth;
    blind and lame are among them, women with child and women in travail—
    they come back, a great com­pany.
        9 	They went away in tears,
    but I lead them back consoled. I guide them to streams of water,
    by smooth roads where they cannot stumble; for to Israel I am a father, and Ephraim is my first-born son.”
        10 	Listen to the Eternal’s word, ye
    nations,
    spread the news to far-off isles; “He who scattered Israel gath­ers them,
    and tends them as a shepherd tends his flock.
        11 	For the Eternal has set Jacob
    free,
    and rescued him from a stronger power.
        12 	So they shall gather singing on
    the heights of Sion,
    all radiant over the Eternal’s bounty,
    yearlings of sheep and cattle, com, oil, and wine;
    for them life shall be like a watered garden, no longer shall they pine.
    The girls shall delight in 13 dancing,
    young men and old shall be merry;
        I 	will change their grief to glad­ness,
    consoling, cheering them after their sorrow;
    I will heap rich food on their 14 priests,
    and satisfy my people with my bounty.
    I have indeed heard Ephraim 18 bemoaning thus his plight:
    ‘Under thy chastening I have been chastened, like an unbroken colt;
    bring me back, let me return, for thou art the Eternal, mv God.
    My exile led me to repent;	19
    when I was chastened, I smote my breast;
    I sink in shame under the pen- alty
    for what I did in youth.’
    Is it because Ephraim is my 20 favourite son, my darling child,
    that whenever I must punish him,
    my heart dwells on him still?
    Yes, my pity stirs for him—
    I must have mercy on him!
    Put up waymarks, set up guide- 21 posts,
    bethink you of the high road, by which you travelled hence.
    Come back by it, 0 maiden Is­rael,
    come back to your home towns here.
        22 	How long will you hesitate,
    O erring daughter?
    Why, the Eternal makes a new thing upon earth; frail woman becomes manly!”
        23 	The Lord of hosts, the God of
    Israel, says:
    “When I restore their fortunes, then in Judah’s land and towns
    once more they shall use this word,
    ‘The Eternal bless you, Home of goodness,
    Sacred heights!’
        24 	There, in Judah and in all her
    townships,
    they shall live together, the men who plough the land, the herdsmen wandering with their flocks;
        25 	for richly I refresh the weary
    life
    and I replenish everyone who pines.”
        26 	[[Here I awoke, I opened wide
    my eyes—
    this was a pretty dream!]]
        27 	“A day comes, the Eternal
    promises,
    when I sow Israel and Judah with the seed of men and the seed of cattle;
        28 	as once I was alert to tear them
    up and harm them, so I will be alert to set them up and plant them.
        29 	Then they shall say no more,
    ‘The fathers ate sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are on edge’;
        30 	but each shall die for his own sin,
    and he who eats the sour grapes,
    his own teeth shall be set on edge.
        31 	A day comes, the Eternal
    promises,
    when I make a fresh compact with all the house of Israel— not like the compact I once 32 made with their fathers, the day I took them by the hand
    to bring them out of Egypt’s land,
    the compact that they broke, till I had to reject them.
    No, this is the compact I make 33 with Israel in the end;
    I will put my law within them,
    writing it on their hearts; and I will be a God to them, and they to me a people; no longer shall they have to 34 teach
    their fellows, each instructing each,
    how to know the Eternal; for they all
    shall know me, both the great and small;
    for I will pardon their offences, their sin I never will recall.
    This is the word of the Eter- 35 nal, who sets the sun to light the day and the moon and stars to light the night, who stirs the sea up till its waters roar (his name, the Lord of hosts): only when this fixed order van- 36 ishes from my sight, says the Eternal, shall the race of Israel cease to be a nation before me for all time. This is the Eter- 37 nal’s word: only when heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below laid bare, will I ever cast off the race of Israel for all that they have done, says the Eternal.
    A day comes, the Eternal de- 38 dares, when the Eternal will have the city rebuilt from the tower of Hananel to the gate at the corner, when the line of 39
    the wall shall run straight south to the hill of Gareb and then 40 turn round to Goah. The very valley of the dead, where the altar-refuse is thrown, with the fields as far as the ravine of Kidron, as far as the corner of the Horse gate eastward, shall all be sacred to the Eternal; never again shall they be torn up or demolished.”
    A message that came from the Eternal to Jeremiah in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah (the eighteenth year of
        2 	Nebuchadrezzar), just when the king of Babylon’s army was besieging Jerusalem. Jeremiah the prophet was a prisoner in the guard-house of the royal palace
        3 	(for Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “What do you mean by prophesying that the Eternal declares, ‘I will hand over this city to the king of Babylon, and he shall capture
        4 	it? Nor shall Zedekiah king of Judah make his escape from the Chaldeans; he shall certainly be given up to the king of Baby­lon, and speak to him person­ally and see him face to face;
        5 	the king shall conduct Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain [[till I remember him, says the Eternal; though you fight the Chaldeans, you shall
        6 	not succeed]]’”). This word from the Eternal came to Jere-
        7 	miah:	“Hanamel the son of
    your uncle is coming to ask you to buy his land at Anathoth, since you have a right to the
        8 	first offer of it.” So Hanamel the son of my uncle came to me in the guard-house, as the Eter­nal had predicted. He said, “Pray buy my land at Ana­thoth; you are the lawful heir, you have a right to the first
    offer; buy it for yourself.” (Then I realized that the word 8 was really the Eternal’s.) I 9 bought the land at Anathoth from Hanamel the son of my uncle, paying him down two pounds seven shillings in silver.
    I signed the deed, sealed it, had 10 it witnessed, and paid down the money in full. Then I took the 11 purchase-deeds, the sealed docu­ment and the covering envelope, and handed them to Baruch the 12 son of Neriah, the son of Mah- seiah, in presence of Hanamel the son of my uncle, in presence of the witnesses who had signed the purchase-deeds, and in pres­ence of all the Jews who were seated in the guard-house. In 13 their presence I gave this charge to Baruch: “These are the 14 orders of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel—take these pur­chase-deeds, the sealed docu­ment and the covering enve­lope, and place them in an earthen jar, that they may last for many a long day. For, says 15 the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, the time will come when houses and lands and vineyards shall again be bought in this country.”
    After I handed the purchase- 16 deeds to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed thus to the Eternal:	“[[Ah! Lord Eter- 17
    nal, thou hast made heaven and earth by thy great power and outstretched arm—nothing lis too hard for thee. Thou 18 showest kindness to thousands, and thou bringest the guilt of fathers home to their children after them, thou great and mighty God, great in counsel 19 and mighty in action, whose eyes are open to all the ways of men, rewarding every man as he has lived, and as his deeds de-
        20 	serve. In Egypt’s land, as ever since, thou didst provide signal deeds of awe, both for Israel and for outsiders; thou didst make thyself a name that is still
        21 	remembered. From Egypt’s land thou didst bring out thy people Israel with signal deeds of awe, by might and main,
        22 	spreading terror around: thou gavest them this land which thou hadst sworn to their fathers to give them, a land abounding in milk and honey;
        23 	they entered in and took pos­session of it, but they would not listen to thy voice nor follow thy directions; they have not done a thing thou didst com­mand them; and so thou hast made all this evil befall them.]]
        24 	Here are siege-mounds for storming the city, and under the sword, the famine, and the pesti­lence, the city is sure to fall into the hands of the Chaldean besiegers! Thy threat has been
        25 	fulfilled, as thou seest. And it was thou, 0 Lord Eternal, who didst tell me to buy the land for money: I had the deeds written and sealed and wit­nessed, and here is the city falling into the hands of the Chaldeans!”
        26 	Then this word from the Eter-
        27 	nal came to me: “I am the Eternal, God over all men; is
        28 	anything too hard for me? [[I am indeed handing this city over to the Chaldeans and to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, who is to capture it.
        29 	The Chaldean besiegers shall come and set fire to this city and burn it, burning up the houses on whose roofs sacrifice was offered to Baal and liba­tions poured out in honour of foreign gods—in order to spite
        30 	me! For ever since they were
    young, the Israelites and the Ju- dahites have done nothing but evil in my sight; ever since the 31 day it was built, down to this day, this city has been provok­ing me to remove it in anger and fury from my presence, for all 32 the evil that the Israelites and the Judahites have done to spite me—themselves, their kings, their authorities, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the citizens of Jerusalem. They have turned 33 their backs to me, not their faces; though I taught them earnestly and urgently, they would not listen and be in­structed. They have defiled 34 the very house that belongs to me, by putting their detestable idols inside it; and they have 35 erected shrines to Baal, in the valley belonging to Ben- Hinnom, for burning alive their sons and daughters to Molek— a thing I never ordered, a thing that never entered my mind, this abominable practice that led Judah into crime!
    “This therefore is the word of 36 the Eternal, the God of Israel, regarding this city. You say, it is falling into the hands of the king of Babylon, under the sword, the famine, and the pes­tilence? But the Eternal de­clares, as surely as I have brought all this grave evil on the people, so surely will I bring upon them all the good I prom­ise. I will gather them from 37 all the countries where I drove them in my anger and fury and fierce wrath, and bring them back to this place, where I will let them live secure; they shall 38 be my people, and I will be their God. I will give them a dif- 39 ferent life, within and without, a life of lasting reverence for me,



    to the good of themselves and of
        40 	their children after them; I will make a lasting compact with them, never to leave off doing them good, and I will put rev­erence for myself in their hearts, that they may never swerve
        41 	from me; yes, I will rejoice over them and settle them in this land faithfully, with all my
        43 	heart and soul.]] In this country that you call desolate, stripped of men and cattle, handed over to the Chaldeans, lands shall
        44 	again be bought; men shall buy lands for money, deeds shall be subscribed and sealed and wit­nessed, both in the district of Benjamin and in the neighbour­hood of Jerusalem and in the townships of Judah, of the high­lands, of the lowlands, and of the south. For I will restore their fortunes, the Eternal promises.”
    When Jeremiah was still a prisoner in the guard-house, a second message came to him
        2 	from the Eternal. “[[This is the word of the Eternal who made the earth and formed it to stand fast—the Eternal is his name:
        3 	Call to me, and I will answer by revealing what is hard and hid­den, what you do not know!]]
        4 	This is the word of the Eternal, the God of Israel, regarding the houses of this city and the royal palaces, which have been broken up to form a barricade against the siege-works and the
        5 	sword. The Chaldeans are coming to fight and to fill them with the corpses of those whom I slay in my anger and fury, men whose wickedness has made me withdraw my favour
        6 	from this city. Yet I will cure the city’s wounds, I will heal her, I will let the people see a
        7 	rich and stable peace. I will
    restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel, and set them up as they were at first. I will cleanse 8 them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebel­lion against me. The city shall 9 bring me joy and praise and glory, while all nations of the world, when they hear of all the good I am doing her, shall tremble in awe at all the good and the welfare I provide for her.”
    This is the Eternal’s word: 10 “In this place that you call des­olate, stripped of men and cat­tle, in the townships of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that lie desolate, stripped of men and cattle, the sound of it mirth and gladness shall again be heard, the voice of bride­groom and bride, the voice of those who bring their thank- offerings into the Eternal’s temple, singing,
    ‘Give thanks to the Lord of hosts,
    for the Eternal is good,
    for his kindness never fails.’
    For I will restore the fortunes of the land, says the Eternal, as at the first. This is the word of 12 the Lord of hosts: In this place so desolate, stripped of men and cattle, and in all its townships, there shall again be homesteads of shepherds, with flocks re­clining beside them; in the town- 13 ships of the highlands, the low­lands, and the south, in the dis­trict of Benjamin, in the neigh­bourhood of Jerusalem, and in the townships of Judah, flocks shall once more file past to be counted up, the Eternal promises.
    A day comes, the Eternal 14 promises, when I shall carry out my gracious purpose for the
    house of Israel and the house
        3 	of Judah. In those days and at that time,
        I 	raise up a true scion of David,
    to enforce law and justice in the land;
        3 	in those days Judah shall be
    safe,
    and Jerusalem live secure, and this shall be her title,
    ‘The Eternal our champion/
        4 	For this is the Eternal’s promise: A Davidic king shall never be lacking to sit upon the
        5 	throne of Israel, nor shall the Levitical priests ever lack a man to offer burnt-offerings in my presence or to burn oblations or to offer sacrifice.”
        6 	This message also came from
        7 	the Eternal to Jeremiah: “This is what the Eternal says: If you could break my compact with day and night, so that day and night should not come round in
        8 	their appointed order, then my compact could be broken with my servant David, and a son of his might fail to sit upon his throne; or my compact with the Levitical priests my ministers
        9 	might be broken. I will make the race of my servant David and of the Levites who minister to me as numberless as the stars in heaven, as measureless as the sands of the sea.”
        10 	This message also came from
        11 	the Eternal to Jeremiah: “Have you not noticed what this people are saying? They say that the Eternal has cast off his two chosen families; they say, he so despises his people that he no longer counts it a nation at all.
        12 	What the Eternal says is this: ‘As surely as I created day and night and fixed the frame of
        13 	heaven and earth, so surely will I never cast off the race of my
    servant David, or fail to choose descendants of his to rule the race of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will restore their fortunes, in pity for them.’ ”
    This message came from o/* the Eternal to Jeremiah, <5^ when Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon and all his army, with all the realms and races of the world under his sway, were attacking Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. “This is what 2 the Eternal, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah the king of Judah and tell him that this is the Eternal’s word: ‘I am handing this city over to the king of Babylon, who shall burn it up; you cannot make 3 your escape from him, you will certainly be captured and put into his hands; you will have to face the king of Babylon and speak to him in person, and to Babylon you must go. But 4 listen to what the Eternal says,
    0 Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the Eternal says regard­ing yourself: you are not to die 5 by the sword, you are to die a peaceful death; and as spices were burned at the burial of your forefathers, the kings be­fore you, so shall they be burned for you, and the lament—“Alas for my lord!”—shall rise for you. I have said the word, the Eternal declares.’ ” So Jere- 6 miah gave this message to Zede­kiah the king of Judah in Jeru­salem, when the king of Baby- 7 Ion’s army was attacking Jeru­salem, Lakhish, and Azekah— the only fortified towns of Judah that were left.
    A message that came from 8 the Eternal to Jeremiah, after king Zedekiah had made a com­pact with all the people in Jeru­salem that freedom was to be 9 proclaimed—every man to set free his Hebrew slaves, male or female, so that no Jew or Jewess should be a slave any longer.
        2 	But although all the authorities and all the people agreed to the compact that everyone should set free his male and female
        3 	slaves, they afterwards forced back into slavery the male and female slaves whom they had lib-
        4 	erated. So this message came from the Eternal to Jeremiah:
        5 	“Here is what the Eternal, the God of Israel, says: ‘Whereas on the day that I brought your fathers out of Egypt’s land, from that slave-pen, I made this com-
        6 	pact with them that at the end of six years they were to release any fellow Hebrew who had been sold to them—at the end of six years’ service they were to set him free (a compact of mine that your fathers would not
        7 	obey or observe); and whereas you on the other hand have now done what I consider right, by proclaiming a general freedom, making a compact in my pres­ence, within the temple that
        8 	belongs to me, and have then turned round and sullied my honour by forcing back into slavery, every one of you, the very male and female slaves whom you had liberated to go
        9 	where they pleased; therefore, the Eternal declares, since you would not obey me and proclaim freedom, each to his brother and fellow, I now proclaim you free, says the Eternal—free to fall under the sword, the pestilence, and the famine! I will make your fate a terror to every king-
        10 	dom upon earth. And as for the men who broke my compact, who did not carry out the terms
    of the compact that they made in my presence when they passed between the pieces of the calf that they had cut in two, as for the authorities of Judah 19 and the authorities of Jerusa­lem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the laity, who passed between the pieces of the calf that they had cut in two, I will 20 hand them over to their enemies, and their dead bodies shall be devoured by wild birds and wild beasts. Zedekiah king of Judah 21 and his leading men I will hand over to their enemies, to the army of the king of Babylon which has retired from besieg­ing you; at my word of com- 22 mand, says the Eternal, they shall return to this city, attack it and capture it and bum it up, and the towns of Judah I will make desolate and uninhab­ited.’”
    A message that came o jr from the Eternal to .Jere- miah during the reign of Jehoia- kim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: “Go to the clan of the 2 Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them into one of the side- rooms in the temple of the Eter­nal; then offer them wine to drink.”
    So I took Jaazaniah, the son 3 of Jeremiah and the grandson of Habazziniah, with his broth­ers and all his sons and the whole clan of the Rechabites; I brought 4 them into the temple of the Eternal, into the side-room be­longing to the sons of Hanan the son of Gedaliah, a man of God; it was near the side-room of the authorities and above the side-room belonging to Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the warden of the Threshold. Then I put 5 bowls full of wine and cups in
    front of the Rechabite clan, and
        6 	told them to drink. But they said, “We will drink no wine, for our ancestor Jonadab the son of Rechab gave us this order: ‘Never drink any wine, neither
        7 	you nor your sons; never build a house, never sow seed, never plant, never own a vineyard; live in tents all your days, so that you may live long on the earth where you are but pass-
        8 	ing guests.’ And we have obeyed our ancestor Jonadab the son of Rechab in every whit; we have drunk no wine, neither we nor our wives nor our sons nor
        9 	our daughters; we have built no houses to dwell in; we have neither vineyard nor field nor
    io	seed; we have lived in tents, obeying our ancestor Jonadab
    ir in every whit. It was only when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon invaded the land, that we thought we had better go to Je­rusalem in order to escape the Babylonian and the Aramaean armies. That is why we are in­side Jerusalem.”
        12 	Then the word of the Eternal
        13 	came to Jeremiah. “This is what the Lord of hosts says: Go and say to the men of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem, ‘Will this not teach you to obey my words? says the Eternal.
        14 	What Jonadab the son of Re­chab told his followers, his com­mand to drink no wine, has been kept; to this day they drink no wine, in obedience to their ancestor’s command. But you have not listened to me, though I spoke to you earnestly
        15 	and urgently. I sent all my servants the prophets to tell you that if you gave up your evil courses, every man of you, and mended your ways, and ceased to follow foreign gods in
    worship, then you would remain in the land that I have given to you and to your fathers. But you would not attend, you would not listen to me. So, as 16 the followers of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command given them by their ancestors, while this people has not listened to me, the Eternal, 17 the -God of hosts, the God of Israel, declares:	Now am I
    about to bring upon Judah and all the citizens of Jerusalem all the misery with which I threat­ened them; for I spoke to them but they would not listen, I called to them but they would not answer.’” But to the 18 clan of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Since you have kept the com­mand of your ancestor Jonadab and carried out all his injunc­tions and done all that he or­dered you, the Lord of hosts, 19 the God of Israel, promises that Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to serve me in my ministry.’ ”
    In the fourth year of Je- 047 hoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this message came to Jeremiah from the Eternal: “Take a scroll and write upon 2 it all that I have ever said to you against Jerusalem and Ju­dah and all the nations, from the day when I first spoke to you in Josiah’s reign down to this day.
    It may be that when the house 3 of Judah hear all the evil that I intend for them, they will all give up their evil life and re­ceive my pardon for their sin and guilt.” So Jeremiah sum- 4 moned Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote upon a scroll, while Jeremiah dictated all that the Eternal had said to him.
        5 	Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am debarred from entering the
        6 	temple; so you must go and read aloud on a fast-day in the temple the words of the Eternal which you have written, to my dictation, on the scroll; the people are to hear them, and you must also read them aloud to the Judaeans who come in
        7 	from the country towns. It may be that, with humble en­treaties to the Eternal, they will give up their evil life, each one of them; for fierce is the anger and fury with which the Eternal has threatened this people.”
    This is what the prophet Jeremiah told Baruch the son of Neriah, after he had writ­ten on the scroll what Jeremiah dictated to him, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim king of Judah:
        2 	“Here is what the Eternal, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:
        3 	You say, ‘Alas now, the Eter­
    nal adds anguish to my pain;
    I am wearied out with moan­ing, rest I cannot!’
        4 	But the Eternal says, ‘Wien I
    have to demolish what I built,
    when I have to uproot what once I planted,
        5 	do you expect smooth fortunes
    for yourself?
    Never expect that! Only, I promise you,
    as I bring doom now upon all mankind,
    I will let you escape with your own life,
    wherever you must go.’ ”
    Q fZ Then Baruch the son of
        5 	dl) Neriah did all that the prophet Jeremiah had told him; he read the words of the Eternal from the scroll within the tem­
    ple. For when all the citizens of 9 Jerusalem and all who came in to Jerusalem from the country towns of Judah were summoned to a fast before the Eternal in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, Baruch io read aloud Jeremiah’s message in the scroll to all the people, from the window of the side- room belonging to Gemariah the son of the secretary Sha- phan, which was inside the upper court at the entrance to the new gate of the temple.
    Now when Micaiah the son of n Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Eter­nal read from the scroll, he is walked down to the palace, where he found all the authori­ties seated in the secretary’s room—Eli sham a the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiali, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hanamah, and all the others. After Mi- 13 caiah had told them all the words that he had heard Ba­ruch read aloud from the seroll to the people, the authorities all 14 sent Jehudi the son of Ne- thaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Kushi, to tell Baruch to bring the scroll from which he had been reading aloud to the people. When Baruch ap­peared, scroll in hand, they told 15 him to sit down and read it aloud. So Baruch read it to them. When they had heard it 16 all, they turned to one another in alarm, whispering, “We must in­form the king of all this.” They 17 asked Baruch, “How did you come to write all this?” Baruch 18 answered “Jeremiah dictated it all to me, and I wrote it down in ink upon the scroll.” So the au- 19
    thorities said to Baruch, “Go into hiding, you and Jeremiah; let no man know where you are.”
        20 	Then, after depositing the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king’s private cabinet and told the
        21 	king everything. The king sent Jehudi for the scroll; and when he brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary, he read it aloud to the king and all the
        22 	authorities in attendance. The king was in his winter apart­ments, with a brazier burning in
        23 	front of him. Whenever Jehudi read three or four leaves, the king would slash them off with a penknife and fling them into the fire burning upon the brazier, till the whole of the scroll was consumed in the fire burning
        24 	upon the brazier. There was no sense of horror, no tearing of clothes, on the part of the king or of any of his ministers who
        25 	heard all these words, although Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gema- riah besought the king not to burn the scroll. However, he
        26 	would not listen to them; he ordered the royal prince Jerah- meel, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Ab- deel, to fetch Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the Eternal hid them safe.
        27 	After the king had burned the scroll containing the words which Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, this word of the Eternal came to Jere-
        28 	miah: “Take once more another scroll, and write upon it all the words that were on the former scroll, which Jehoiakim the
        29 	king of Judah burned. And give Jehoiakim king of Judah this message from the Eternal: ‘You burned the scroll and asked me why I had written in
    it that the king of Babylon was coming to destroy this land and clear it of man and beast. Well, 30 here is what the Eternal has to say about Jehoiakim king of Judah: No descendant of his shall ever sit upon the throne of David, and his own corpse shall be flung out, exposed to the day’s heat and to the frost by night. I will punish him, his 31 offspring, and his ministers, for their evil doing; I will bring upon them and the citizens of Jerusalem all the miseries with which I have threatened them in vain.’ ” So Jeremiah took an- 32 other scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote upon it, to Jeremiah’s dictation, all the words of the book that Jehoia­kim king of Judah had burned, besides many other words of the same nature.
    Zedekiah the son of 0^7 Josiahwas reigning in place • of Koniah the son of Jehoiakim, having been set upon the throne of Judah by Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon. Neither he nor 2 his ministers nor the people of the country paid any heed to messages of the Eternal deliv­ered by the prophet Jeremiah. However, when the Pharaoh’s 5 army had set out from Egypt, and when news of this led the Chaldeans to abandon their siege of Jerusalem, king Zedekiah 3 sent Jehukal the son of Shele­miah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to ask Jere­miah if he would pray for them to the Eternal their God. (Jere- 4 miah was moving in and out among the people; he had not yet been imprisoned.) Then this 6 word came from the Eternal to Jeremiah:	“The Eternal, the 7
    God of Israel, bids you say this to the king of Judah who sent you to consult me:	‘This
    army of the Pharaoh, advancing to relieve you, shall retreat to
        2 	Egypt, its own country, and the Chaldeans shall come back to assault this city, capturing it and
        3 	burning it in flames. Do not de­lude yourselves, says the Eternal, with the notion that the Chal­deans will leave you alone; they will not leave you alone.
        4 	Though you were to defeat the whole of this Chaldean host arrayed against you, till none were left but wounded men, one to a tent, they would start up to burn this city in the flames.’ ”
        5 	When the Chaldean forces had abandoned the siege of Jerusalem, in fear of the Pha-
        6 	raoh’s army, Jeremiah started from Jerusalem for the district of Benjamin, to take over some property among his own people.
        7 	But just as he reached the Ben­jamin-gate of the city, he was arrested by a sentry called Irijah, the son of Shelemiah and the grandson of Hananiah, who shouted to the prophet Jere­miah, “You are deserting to the
        8 	Chaldeans!” “It is a lie,” said Jeremiah, “I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” However, Irijah would not listen to him; he arrested Jeremiah and took
        9 	him to the authorities, who in anger had Jeremiah flogged and confined in the house of the secretary Jonathan, which had
        10 	been turned into a prison. So Jeremiah found himself in the dungeon cells, where for some time he had to stay.
        11 	Then king Zedekiah sent for him privately, and interviewed him in the palace. “Is there any word from the Eternal?” he asked. “There is,” said Jere­
    miah, adding, “word that you are to be handed over to the king of Babylon!” Jeremiah then asked 18 king Zedekiah, “For what crime against yourself or your min­isters or this nation have you put me in prison? Pray where 19 have you put your prophets, who assured you that the king of Babylon would never attack you or this country? Listen, my 20 lord king, be gracious to my plea; let me not be taken back to the house of the secretary Jonathan, or I shall die there.”
    So king Zedekiah gave orders for 21 Jeremiah to be placed in the guard-house, where he got a loaf from the bakers’ bazaar every day, so long as any bread was left within the city.
    Jeremiah lay in the qo guard-house. But Shepha- tiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jehukal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah, had heard Jeremiah declaring in public that the Eternal said, “Anyone who 2 remains in the city shall die by the sword or by famine or by plague, but anyone who sur­renders to the Chaldeans shall live, escaping with his life,” or that the Eternal said, “This 3 city shall certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon and captured.” So 4 these authorities said to the king, “Pray have this fellow put to death; he takes the heart out of all the citizens and sol­diers left within the city, by talking like this! The fellow is out to ruin the city, not to help it!” “Well,” said king Zede- 5 kiah, “he is in your hands”— for the king was powerless against them. So they took 6 Jeremiah and put him into an underground cistern belonging
    to the royal prince Malchiah, below the guard-house, lowering him down with ropes; the cistern held no water, only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
        7 	However, an Ethiopian eunuch called Ebedmelek, belonging to the royal household, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the
        8 	cistern. So Ebedmelek left the palace to find the king who was then seated as judge at the Ben-
        9 	jamin-gate. “Your majesty,” he said, “these men have treated the prophet Jeremiah foully; they have put him into a cistern, and he will die on the spot from starvation, for there is no food
    io	left in the city.” Then the king ordered Ebedmelek to take three men and pull Jeremiah out of the cistern before he died.
    n Ebedmelek took the men with him and went to the palace, where he got some tom, tattered rags out of a lumber-room be­low the treasury; these he low­ered by ropes to Jeremiah in
        12 	the cistern, saying, “Put them between your armpits and the
        13 	ropes.” Jeremiah did so. And they pulled him up by the ropes out of the cistern.
        14 	Jeremiah then stayed in the guard-house. King Zedekiah sent for the prophet Jeremiah to the guards’ entrance into the temple. The king said, “I ask you a question which you must
        15 	answer frankly.” Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, “But if I tell you the truth, you will cer­tainly put me to death, will you not? Besides, you will not listen
        16 	to any advice from me.” So the king swore this oath in secret to Jeremiah: “As the Eternal lives, who made this life of ours, I will not put you to death, nor will I hand you over to these murder­ous men.”
    Then Jeremiah said to Zede- 17 kiah, “This is what the Eternal says, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘If you surrender to the king of Babylon’s officers, then you save your life, and this city shall not be burned in flames; you and your household will be spared. But if you will not sur- 18 render to the king of Babylon’s officers, then this city shall be handed over to the Chaldeans to be burned in flames, and you cannot escape from their hands.” King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, 19 “But I am afraid the Chaldeans may hand me over to the Jews who have deserted to them, and they may ill-treat me.” “They 20 shall not hand you over,” Jere­miah answered; “do listen to what I say—it is the voice of the Eternal—and then all will go well with you, and you shall five. But if you refuse to sur- 21 render, then I have this vision for you from the Eternal: I saw 22 all the women who are left within the palace of the king of Judah, led away to the officers of the king of Babylon, and chanting as they went,
    ‘Your bosom friends have been too much for you
    and led you far astray; they got your feet deep in the mud,
    then turned away.’
    All your wives and children 23 shall be led away to the Chal­deans, and you yourself cannot escape from their hands; you shall be captured by the king of Babylon, and this city burned in flames.”
    Then Zedekiah said to Jere- 24 miah, “Keep this interview a se­cret, and your life is safe. If the 25 authorities hear that I have been talking to you, and if they come and ask you to tell them what
    you said to the king and what the king said to you, on pain of death if you will not disclose it,
        26 	then you must tell them that you were petitioning the king not to be sent back to die at Jonathan’s
        27 	house.” The authorities did all come and question Jeremiah, and he answered them just as the king had told him; so they said no more, for the interview had
        28 	been quite private. Jeremiah then remained within the guard­house till the day Jerusalem fell. QQ It was during Jeremiah’s
        13 	detention in the guard­house that this message came to
        14 	him from the Eternal, “Go and tell Ebedmelek the Ethiopian that the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: ‘Though I am bringing evil and not good upon
        15 	this city, as I said I would, yet I will preserve you on that day —so the Eternal promises; you shall not be handed over to the
        16 	men you are afraid of. I will certainly rescue you; you shall not fall by the sword, but you shall escape with your life, be­cause you have put your trust in me—so the Eternal prom­ises.’ ”
    OO	When Jerusalem fell, the
    28 dO officers of the king of on Babylon all came and held 3 *5-' a council at the middle gate of the city—Nergalsarezer the cavalry commander, Ne- bushazban the field-marshal, and all the other officers of the
    14 king of Babylon; they sent for Jeremiah from the guard-house and entrusted him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and the grandson of Shaphan, who was to take him to his own house. So Jeremiah stayed among the people.
    flln the tenth month of the ninth year of the reign of
    Zedekiah king of Judah, Neb­uchadrezzar king of Babylon with all his army attacked Jerusalem and besieged it; on the 2 ninth day of the fourth month of the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, a breach was made in the walls of the city, and 'when 4 Zedekiah king of Judah and the garrison saw this, they all took to flight, leaving the city during the night, through the royal gar­dens, by the gate between the two walls. They made for the Jordan valley. However, the 5 Chaldean army went in pursuit of them and overtook Zedekiah in the steppes of Jericho; they caught him and carried him to Nebuchadrezzar king of Baby­lon, at Riblah in the district of Hamath, where sentence was passed upon the prisoners. At 6 Riblah the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before their father’s eyes; the king of Baby­lon also slew all the officials of Judaea; he then put out the eyes 7 of Zedekiah and chained him fast, to carry him to Babylon.
    The Chaldeans burned down 8 the royal palace and the houses of the common people, and they demolished the walls of Jerusa­lem. Nebuzaradan the com- 9 mander-in-ehief carried off to exile in Babylon the citizens who remained in the city, and those who had deserted to him, with all the craftsmen who were left. However, he did leave in 10 the land of Judah some poor people who were penniless, allot­ting them vineyards and fields.
    As for Jeremiah, Nebuchad- 11 rezzar king of Babylon issued these orders to Nebuzaradan the commander-in-chief: “Take good 12 care of him; do him no harm, but treat him as he wishes.” So 13 a message to this effect was for-
    warded by Nebuzaradan the commander-in-chief to Nebu- shazban the field-marshal, and Nergalsarezer the cavalry com­mander, and the other principal officers of the king of Babylon.]] /i fl A message that came from the Eternal to Jeremiah,
        1 	after he had been released from Ramah by Nebuzaradan the commander-in-chief, who had found him there, chained among the prisoners who were all being carried from Jerusalem and Judsea into exile at Babylon: O I “Here is what the Eternal
    says:
        15 	‘A sound is heard at Ramah,
    a wail, a passion of tears—
    ’tis Rachel sobbing for her chil­dren,
    sobbing for her children gone,
    refusing to be comforted.
        16 	But cease your sobbing,
    stay your eyes from tears; your labour for the children is not lost,
    they shall return from the land of their foes;
        17 	there is hope for you in days to
    come,
    your children shall return— the Eternal promises.’ ”
    The commander-in-chief tc1” took Jeremiah and said to
        1 	him, “The Eternal your God pro­nounced this sentence of doom upon this place, and he has kept
        2 	his word; it is because you sinned against the Eternal and would not listen to him, that this has
        3 	happened to you. Well now, I am releasing you to-day from the chains upon your hands. If you care to come with me to Baby­lon, I will take good care of you. If not, then never mind; all the land lies open to you, go wher­ever you think right and good.
        4 	Go back to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and the grandson of
    Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed gover­nor of the towns of Judah; stay with him, or go wherever else you choose.” Then the com­mander-in-chief sent him off with some food and a present; Jeremiah did go to Gedaliah 6 the son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and stayed wi th him among the people who were left in the land.
    When the leaders of the Jew- 7 ish forces throughout the coun­try heard that the king of Baby­lon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam as governor of the land, in charge of the destitute men, women, and children who had not been carried off to exile in Babylon, they and their men 8 all went to Gedaliah at Mizpah; there were Ishmael the son of Nethaniali, Johanan and Jona­than the sons of Kareah, Se- raiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai from Neto- phah, and Jezaniah the son of a man from Maakah. Geda- 9 liah pledged his word to them and to their men, swearing that they need not fear to serve the Chaldeans; “stay on in the country,” he said, “serve the king of Babylon, and all will go well with you. For my 10 part I reside at Mizpah in order to represent your interests when­ever Chaldean officials arrive upon the scene; but you can gather and store up wine, fruit, and oil; you can live in any towns you care to occupy.”
    When all the Jews in Moab, n Ammon, Edom, and elsewhere, heard that the king of Babylon had allowed some Jews to stay on in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam as governor, they too returned to 12 Judah from the countries to which they had been driven;
    they went to Gedaliah at Miz- pah, and gathered large stores of wine and fruit.
        5 	Now Johanan the son of Kareah went with all the other leaders of the Jewish forces to Gedaliah at Mizpah and asked
        6 	him, “Are you aware that Baa- lis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Netha- niah to murder you?” Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not
        7 	believe it. Johanan the son of Kareah then had a private in­terview with him at Mizpah; he asked him, “Do let me go and kill Ishmael. No one need know about it. Why should he murder you? It will mean the dispersal of all the Jews who have rallied round you, and the ruin of all who are left in
        8 	Judah.” “No,” said Gedaliah to Johanan, “you must not do that; what you say about Ish­mael is not true.”
    But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Netha- niah and the grandson of Eli- shama, a member of the royal family, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah; as they dined together,
        2 	Ishmael and his ten companions drew their swords and murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and the grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon had ap­pointed as governor of the
        3 	country. Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Geda­liah at Mizpah, and all the Chal­dean soldiers who happened to be there.
        4 	Next day, before any one knew
        5 	about Gedaliah’s murder, eighty pilgrims arrived from Shechem, Shilo, and Samaria, their beards shaved off, their bodies gashed, and their clothes torn, bringing vegetables and frankincense to
    be offered at the temple. Ishmael 6 the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, as they marched along wailing. When he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.” But as soon as they 7 were inside the town, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and his companions murdered them and flung their bodies into an under­ground cistern. Ten men 8 among them, however, said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us; we have stores hidden in the fields, wheat, barley, oil, and honey.”
    So he let them alone and did not murder them along with their fellows. (The cistern into 9 which Ishmael flung all the corpses of the men he murdered, was the large cistern constructed by king Asa during his campaign against Baasha Mng of Israel; the men whom Ishmael mur­dered filled it full.) Ishmael then 10 carried off as prisoners all the rest of the people at Mizpah, and the princesses whom Nebu- zaradan the commander-in­chief had left in charge of Geda­liah the son of Ahikam.
    He started across country for Ammon. But as soon as Johanan 11 the son of Kareah and the other leaders of the Jewish forces heard of all the crimes com­mitted by Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, they mustered all 12 their men and set out to attack him. They came upon Ishmael the son of Nethaniah at the large pool of Gibeon. When the pris- 13 oners whom Ishmael had carried off from Mizpah saw Johanan the son of Kareah and the other leaders of the forces with him, they all rejoiced and broke 14 away to join Johanan. Ishmael 15 escaped with eight of his men, and got away to the Ammonites,
        12 	while Johanan the son of Ka­reah and the other leaders of the forces with him took charge of all the people whom Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had car­ried off as prisoners from Miz- pah after his murder of Geda- liah the son of Ahikam, men, women, children, and eunuchs.
        13 	They travelled on, stopping for a while at the sheepfolds of Kim- ham near Bethlehem, whence they intended to move on to
        14 	Egypt; for they were terrified of the Chaldeans, because Ish­mael the son of Nethaniah had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as gov­ernor of the country.
    Then all the leaders of the Jewish forces, with Joha­nan the son of Kareah, Azariah the son of Maaseiah, and all the people high and low, said to the
        3 	prophet Jeremiah, “Let us en­treat you to favour us by pray­ing for us to the Eternal your God, a mere remnant as we are. We are but a few left out of many, as you can see for your-
        3 	self; let the Eternal your God di­rect us where to go and what to
        4 	do.” “I hear you,” said Jere­miah; “I will indeed pray to the Eternal your God, as you desire, and I will tell you whatever the Eternal’s answer may be, keep-
        5 	ing nothing back.” Then they said to Jeremiah, “The Eternal be our true and faithful witness that we will follow any instruc­tions which the Eternal sends to
        6 	us through you. Whether it be welcome or unwelcome, we will obey the word of the Eternal our God to whom we send you, and so obeying prosper.”
        7 	Ten days later, the Eternal’s
        8 	word came to Jeremiah. He summoned Johanan the son of
    Kareah and all the other leaders of the Jewish forces, along with all the people high and low, and 9 said to them, “Here is the word of the Eternal, the God of Is­rael, to whom you sent me with your humble petition: If only io you remain in this country, I will build you up, instead of pulling you down; I will plant you, instead of uprooting you; for I am sorry about the misery I have inflicted on you. You ii are terrified of the king of Baby­lon? Never fear him, never fear him, the Eternal says, for I will be with you to rescue you from his hands. I will have ia pity on you, and move him to have pity on you and allow you to remain in your own country. But if you say, ‘We will not 13 remain in this country,’ if you disobey the Eternal your God and say, ‘No, we will go to 14 Egypt and make our home in a land where we shall see no more war and hear no blare of trum­pets and never starve,’ then 15 listen to what the Eternal says,
        0 	survivors of Judah; the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, de­clares, ‘If you are bent on going to Egypt and if you really settle there, then the sword you dread 16 shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, the hunger that you fear shall pursue you into Egypt, and you shall die there; all who are bent on going to 17 settle in Egypt shall die by the sword, by famine, or by plague, not one of them shall survive or escape the fate that I inflict upon them. Here is what the 18 Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: As my fury and anger have been poured out on the citizens of Jerusalem, so shall my fury be poured out upon you, when you enter Egypt;
    you shall become an object of execration and horror, accursed and derided, and you shall never see this place again!’
        12 	0 survivors of Judah, this is the Eternal’s word to you, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ You will go? Then be sure of this, you have
        13 	ruined yourselves. I testify against you for sending me to the Eternal our God, asking me to pray for you to the Eternal our God, promising to do what­ever I told you was the will of
        14 	the Eternal our God, and then, after I told you to-day, refusing to listen to any orders which the Eternal sends you by me.
        15 	For that, be sure, you are doomed to die by the sword, or by famine, or by the plague in the land where you choose to go and settle.”
    When Jeremiah had fin­ished telling all the people all the words that the Eternal their God had sent him to de-
        2 	liver to them, Azarfah the son of Maaseiah and Johanan the son of Kareah and the rest of that insolent group, said to Jeremiah, “You are a liar; the Eternal our God never sent you to forbid us
        3 	to go and settle in Egypt; it is Baruch the son of Neriah who is setting you against us! He would have us handed over to the Chal­deans to be killed or carried prisoners to Babylon.”
        4 	So Johanan the son of Kareah, with all the other leaders of the Jewish forces and all the people, refused to obey the Eternal’s order to remain in the country
        5 	of Judah; Johanan the son of Kareah and all the other leaders took the survivors in Judah, who had come back to
        6 	settle in the country, men, women, and children, princesses, every person who had been
    entrusted by Nebuzaradan the commander-in-chief to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and the grandson of Shaphan, took them all, including the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch the son of Neriah; heedless of what the 7 Eternal said, they entered the land of Egypt and reached Daphne.
    At Daphne this message from 8 the Eternal came to Jeremiah: “Take some large stones in your 9 hand, let some of the Jews see you hiding them secretly under the paved court in front of the entry to the Pharaoh’s house at Daphne, and tell them that this 10 is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I am send­ing for my servant Nebuchadrez­zar, king of Babylon, who shall erect his throne over these stones that you have buried, spreading his state carpet on the top of them. He shall come to ravage 11 the land of Egypt, inflicting death on those who are doomed to die, capturing those doomed to be imprisoned, and putting to the sword those who are doomed to the sword; he shall set fire to 12 the temples of the gods in Egypt, burning them and car­rying off the idols; he shall scour the land of Egypt as a shepherd picks vermin out of his plaid; he shall demolish the obelisks of 13 Beth-shemesh, and then leave unmolested.’ ”
    Here is the message that a A came to Jeremiah about all the Jews who were living in Egypt, at Migdol, Daphne, Memphis, and in Upper Egypt: “The Lord of hosts, the God of 2 Israel, declares: ‘You have seen all the misery I have inflicted on Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. There they lie to-day, empty and desolate, for their 3
    wicked practices that angered me! They took to offering sac­rifices in the service of foreign gods, unknown to them or to yourselves or to your fathers.
        3 	1 sent you all my servants the prophets, earnestly and urgently, to forbid this abomination which
        4 	I hated; but they would not listen or obey, they would not give up their wicked practice of
        5 	sacrificing to foreign gods. So my fury and my anger broke out blazing through the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, laying them waste and desolate, as they lie to-
        6 	day. Now then, says the Eternal, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, why will you ruin yourselves and put an end to Judah, man, woman, child,
        7 	and babe? Why anger me with your practices, sacrificing to foreign gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to settle? It will mean the end of you; all nations upon earth will
        8 	curse and taunt you. Have you forgotten the crimes of your fathers, and of the kings and leaders of Judah, ay and the crimes of your own wives in the country of Judah and in the
        9 	streets of Jerusalem? It has not made them humble or afraid, not to this day; they have not followed my directions nor have they lived by the rules I gave to you and to your
        10 	fathers. Therefore, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I have determined on evil against you, to make an end of
        11 	Judah; as for the survivors of Judah who made up their minds to go and settle in the land of Egypt, in the land of Egypt shall they all perish, all of them, falling by the sword and famine, dying young and old by sword
    and famine, and becoming an object of horror and execration, accursed and derided. For, as 13 I punished Jerusalem, so will I punish all who have settled in the land of Egypt, by sword, by famine, and by plague, till not a 14 single Jewish settler in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive to make his way back to the longed-for land of Judah; only a fugitive or two shall ever get back.’ ”
    Then all the men who knew 15 that their wives sacrificed to for­eign gods, and all the women who were standing by, shouted loudly to Jeremiah, “We will not 16 listen to this word of yours that you have uttered as from the Eternal. No, we mean to keep 17 without fail this oath of ours to offer sacrifices to the Queen of heaven, and pour libations in her honour, as we used to do, we and our fathers, our kings and lead­ers, in the towns of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of food, we pros­pered and came to no harm. But ever since we gave up sac- 18 rificing to the Queen of heaven and pouring out libations in her honour, we have beCn in utter need and at the mercy of the sword and famine.” “Yes,” 19 cried the women, “and had we not the consent of our husbands when we sacrificed to the Queen of heaven and poured libations in her honour and made cakes in the shape of her?” [[Then 20 Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women who had given this answer: “You offered 21 these sacrifices in the towns of Judah and on the streets of Jeru­salem, you and your fathers, your kings and leaders and the commons? Yes, and did the Eternal forget it? Did it not 22
    rankle in his mind, till he could bear your wicked practices and abominable crimes no longer? That is why your land lies deso­late and empty, horrible and ac-
        12 	cursed, to-day. This doom is yours to-day, because you offered these sacrifices, because you sinned against the Eternal and would not obey him, be­cause you would not follow his directions and orders and in­junctions.”]]
        13 	Then Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women: “Listen to the word of the
        35 	Eternal. The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares: You women have done all you swore to do, saying, ‘We will perform our vows without fail, sacrificing to the Queen of heaven and pouring libations in her honour.’ Well, keep your
        26 	word, carry out your vows! But listen to the Eternal’s word, you Jews in Egypt: ‘I swear by my great name that my name shall never be heard on the lips of any Jew who has gone to
        28 	settle in Egypt. Then the sur­vivors of the Jews in Egypt will find out whose word stands,
        29 	mine or theirs. And here is the sign that I will punish you in this country, the Eternal says, to teach you that my threat of doom will stand against you:
        30 	I will deliver the Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, into the hands of his enemies and mur­derers, as I put Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Neb­uchadrezzar king of Babylon,
    his enemy and murderer.’ ”

    Messages from the Eternal to the prophet Jeremiah about the nations. 8
    Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt at Karkemish on the river Eu­phrates, where it was defeated by Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
    Ready with your shields and 3 targes,
    forward to the fray!
    Harness horses, mount your 4 chargers,
    on with helmets, swing your spears,
    don your coats of mail!
    What! routed, in a panic!	5
    Their braves are beaten, they fly, never rally, beset by terror;
    but no speed saves them,	6
    no hero escapes, in the north, by the Euphrates, they collapse.
    What is this, rising like the Nile, 7 with tossing floods?
    ’Tis Egypt shouting, “I will en- 8 gulf the world,
        I 	rise to sweep off its inhabi­tants!”
    Prance on, horses, rage away, 9 chariots,
    charge on, warriors, men with shields from Kush and Punt,
    bowmen from Libya!
    But this is Lord Eternal’s day, 10 a day for vengeance on his foes,
    a day when the sword devours with a vengeance, drinking its fill of blood; for the Lord of hosts is sacri­ficing victims
    in the north, by the Eu­phrates.
    You may get balsam from 11 Gilead,
    my lady Egypt, but all your salves are vain,
    for you there is no healing.
        12 	The whole world hears you
    wailing,
    your crying rings around, for one brave falls over another, and both drop to the ground.
        13 	The Eternal’s prediction to the prophet Jeremiah that Neb­uchadrezzar king of Babylon would come and ravage the land of Egypt:
        14 	Tell it in Migdol,
    proclaim it at Memphis:
    “To your feet, be all ready, the sword sweeps all round you!”
        15 	Why has Apis run away?
    That Bull-god could not stand,
    for the Eternal laid him low.
        16 	Your foreign traders fall away,
    they fall and to themselves they say,
    “Let us begone to the land of our birth, back home again, away from the sweep of the sword.”
        17 	(Call the Pharaoh “Fatality,”
    for he has let his chance go by!)
        18 	By my life, says the King, the
    Lord of hosts, here comes an invader, towering like mount Tabor, like Karmel by the sea!
        19 	Get ready for your exile,
    my lady Egypt;
    for Memphis empty lies and desolate,
    burned to the very ground.
        20 	Egypt is a handsome heifer,
    but herdsmen from the north shall master her; her day of doom has dawned,
        21 	her punishing hour is upon
    her;
    the soldiers that she hired have proved like pampered kine,
    they scampered off in flight, they made no stand.
    She can but draw back hissing 22 like a snake before her foes; for they outnumber locusts, 23 past all counting,
    they come at her with axes, 22 like woodmen hewing a tree, while the Eternal cries out, “Fell 23 her forest, dense though it be.”
    My lady Egypt is dishonoured, 24 in the hands of the north- men.
    The Lord of hosts, the God 25 of Israel, declares: “I will pun­ish Amon the god of Thebes, and also the Pharaoh with any who rely on him; I will hand 26 them over to their murderers, to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Though in after days Egypt shall be inhabited as it was in the days of old (so the Eternal promises).”
    A message from the a rj Eternal that came to the * prophet Jeremiah about the Phil­istines, before the Pharaoh stormed Gaza. The Eternal de­clares:
    “Floods are gathering there, in 2 the north,
    they swell into a torrent, to flood the land and all it holds,
    the capital and all its citizens!
    At the thunder of hoofs in the 3 cavalry charge, at the rush and roar of the chariot wheels,
    fathers fear to turn and save their children— so unmanned are the Philis­tines!
    The day of havoc strips from 4 Tyre and Sidon any support still left them; for the Eternal will make havoc
    of all left upon the coast.
        5 	Gaza mourns with shaven head,
    Ashkelon is overwhelmed;
    Poor Ekron—all that is left of you!—
    long will you gash yourself in grief.”
        6 	“Sword of the Eternal,” you
    cry,
    “will you never be quiet?
    Sheathe yourself and give o’er!”
        7 	But how can it be quiet,
    when it has the Eternal’s orders
    to execute on Ashkelon and the shore?
    /i o On Moab.
    w The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, declares:
    “Alas for Nebo, it is sacked!
    Kureyat captured, to its shame,
    and Moab’s bulwark stormed!
    a Moab now has lost its fame;
    from Heshbon foes have planned
    to blot the nation out of being,
    to press upon it, sword in hand,
    to leave it not a sound of life.
        3 	Hark! a howl from Horonaim,
    for the havoc and the slaugh­ter;
        4 	Moab is shattered,
    and her cry rings even to Zoar.
        5 	Moabites climb up to Luhith,
    weeping as they go;
    for, hurrying down from Horo­naim,
    they heard shrieks of slaugh­ter. 9 10
    Kemosh your god shall be de­ported,
    with his priests and princes; every town shall be despoiled, 8 not one escapes; valleys shall be raided, and plains ruined— so the Eternal orders.
    Give Moab wings?	9
    She fain would fly away from towns laid waste, all emptied!
    No, a curse on him who slackens io in this work of the Eternal!
    A curse on any who will stint their swords of blood!
    Moab from the first has lain at ii ease,
    never known exile afar, lain like wine left on the lees, never poured from jar to jar, that tastes the same as ever, and its scent mellows never.
    But the day comes, says the 12 Eternal,
    when I send men to move him,
    tilting him up and over, emptying out his casks, and breaking up his flasks.
    Then Moab shall find Kemosh 13 fail him,
    like Israel when it trusted Bethel.
    ‘You boast yourselves brave he- 14 roes
    you are warriors bold, and here is your Moab invaded, 15 and the flower of his youth mowed down!’— says the King called the Lord of hosts.
    Moab’s calamity closes upon 16 him,
    and fast his fate comes on. Bemoan him, all ye neighbour- 17 ing folk,
    all ye who know his fame;
    cry, ‘Ah, his sceptre strong is snapped,
    his splendid sway has gone!’
        15 	O dwellers in Dibon, down from
    your height, and cower in the mire; for Moab’s invader attacks you,
    and storms your stronghold!
        16 	O dwellers in Aroer,
    stand on the road, look out, ask news from men in flight and women who escape.
        17 	‘Moab is broken, to his shame,’
    they sigh,
    ‘Wail for it, cry.’ ”
        18 	[[Tell the news upon the banks of Arnon, that Moab is devastated, that doom has reached the plains, reached Ho-
        19 	Ion, Jahzah, Mephaath, Dibon,
        20 	Nebo, Beth-diblathaim, Kure- yat, Beth-gamul, Beth-meon,
        21 	Keriyyoth, Bezer, and all the towns of Moab, far and near.]]
        22 	Moab’s strength is lopped off,
    Moab’s mighty arm is broken;
        23 	make him drunk and help­
    less,
    for his insolence to the Eter­nal.
    Loud was Moab in derision;
    so let him be derided.
        24 	For Israel you did deride;
    you tossed your head in scorn, whenever you talked of him, as of one caught in a thieves’ gang.
        25 	Leave your towns, take to the
    cliffs,
    you folk of Moab; make your nests like doves in crevices of crags.
        26 	We have heard of Moab’s pride,
    his lordly pride, his airs and arrogance, and haughty heart.
    The Eternal says, “I know his 30 rage,
    his hollow vaunts, his hollow
    deeds.” _
    So I must wail for Moab,	31
    lamenting for all Moab, bemoaning what befalls Kir- heres.
    O vine of Sibmah, I join Jazer 32 in bewailing you; for once your branches stretched across
    as far as Jazer, and now your gathered grapes are being ravaged, now Moab’s garden-land is all 33 bereft
    of joy and gladness, no wine is trodden out from grapes,
    no lilting at the vintage!
    Heshbon and Elealeh wail, 34 from Zoar to Jahaz goes the cry,
    Horonaim and Eglath-the-third call out,
    for even Nimrim’s streams are dry.
    [[I also abolish in Moab, says 35 the Eternal,
    all worshippers at shrines, all those who sacrifice to idols.]]
    So my heart thrills with pity 3b for poor Moab,
    thrills for the fate of Kir-heres, losing all his gains.
    Heads are shaven, beards cut 37 close,
    hands are gashed, and sack­cloth worn,
    on all the roofs of Moab, in its 38
    streets,
    men moan and mourn; for I have shattered Moab like a discarded dish.
    How shattered! (ah, bewail it!) 39 defeated and disgraced!
    All around are over-awed,
    and yet mock at Moab.
        40 	For (this is the Eternal’s word) here is an eagle swooping
    with a dash on Moab!
        41 	Towns are taken,
    fortresses surprised; the heart of Moab’s heroes on that day
    is weak as any woman’s in her pangs.
        42 	Moab no more is a nation,
    for its insolence to the Eternal.
        43 	Panic and pitfall and snares
    await you,
    O inhabitants of Moab;
        44 	fly from the panic, you are in a
    pitfall—
    crawl out, you are caught in a snare!
    For I am bringing upon Moab (the Eternal says) its year of punishment.
        45 	Fugitives cower for shelter at
    Heshbon, all in vain;
    for a blaze began at Heshbon, flaming out from Sihon’s pal­ace,
    till Ar of Moab was consumed, and Arnon’s heights devoured.
        46 	Poor Moabites!
    O forlorn folk of Kemosh!
    The god has left your sons to flight,
    your daughters to a prisoner’s plight.
        47 	[[Though in the latter days— so the Eternal promises—I will restore the fortunes of Moab.]]
    [[Here ends the sentence passed on Moab.]]
    On the Ammonites.
    Here is the Eternal’s word: Has Israel no sons, no heir? Why, then, is Gad claimed by god Milkom?
    Why do his people tenant towns of Gad?
        2 	Therefore a day comes (the Eternal declares)
    when I will send the war-cry against Rabbah of the Am­monites,
    till it is left a desolate heap, its townships in the flames.
    Then shall Israel come to hold those who now hold her.
    Howl, O palace of Rabbah,	3
    at the sack of the city!
    Scream, ye women of Rabbah, gird yourselves with sack­cloth,
    wail and run about in mourn­ing:
    for Milkom is deported with his priests and princes.
    Why vaunt your valleys,	4
    you careless creature, so proud of your resources, so sure you are beyond at­tack?
    I will put you in terror	5
    of all who are around you, says the Lord, the Lord of hosts,
    till you are routed headlong, past all rallying.
    [[Though later on, so the 6 Eternal promises, I will restore the fortunes of the Ammon­ites.]]
    On Edom.	7
    Here is the word from the Lord of hosts:
    Teman is no longer shrewd; wary men have lost their wits, their shrewdness has failed them.
    So turn and fly to your re- 8 treats,
    ye dwellers in Dedan; for I bring upon Esau his doom,
    his hour of punishment.
    If gatherers of grapes came 9 upon you,
    would they leave any grapes to glean?
    If robbers in the night came on you,
    would they not steal more than they need?
        7 	So I strip Esau clean and bare,
    I have laid open his retreats,
    till he cannot conceal himself—
    he is stamped out to a man.
        8 	Yet leave to me your orphans,
    I will save them; let your widows trust to me.
        9 	Here is the Eternal’s sen­tence: “If those who did not deserve to drink the cup of the divine anger have to drink it notwithstanding, are you to go unpunished? No, you shall not
        10 	get off; drink it you must. For I have sworn by my own life, that Busaireh shall be waste and cursed, desolate and de­rided, with all its hamlets laid in ruin for all time.”
        11 	The Eternal sends me news of an envoy sent to the na­tions,
    bidding them muster against Edom,
    to make war upon her.
        12 	“For I will make you least
    among the nations, despised in the world of men.
        13 	How you will shudder then!
    Your pride of heart has played you false, perched in your fastness of the rocks,
    ensconced upon your preci­pices!
    Nest high as any eagle, but I will pull you down, says the Eternal,
        14 	till Edom is a shocking deso­
    lation,
    till passers-by whistle in sur­prise
    and horror at its ruin;
        15 	as when Sodom and Gomorrah
    fell,
    with the towns around them, not a soul shall live there, not a man shall dwell there.
    Like shepherds when the lion 19
    leaves
    the jungle of Jordan for the pasture,
    I will chase them away sud­denly,
    and seize their rarest rams.
    Who can match me? Who dare challenge me?
    What shepherd can face me? Hear, then, the Eternal’s plan 20 against Edom,
    his purpose for the Teman- ites:
    their shepherd lads shall be
    dragged away,
    and the farm appalled at their fate!
    Earth trembles at the crash of 21 Edom’s fall;
    the noise resounds to the Reed Sea.
    Here is an eagle swooping	22
    with a dash upon Busaireh!
    The heart of Edom’s warriors on that day
    is weak as any woman’s in her pangs.”
    On Damascus.	23
    Hamath and Arpad are dumb­founded,
    when the bad news comes; they surge uneasy as the sea, restless in their anxiety. Damascus has collapsed,	24
    and turned to fly, seized suddenly with shuddering, caught by sharp anguish, like a woman in her pangs.
    Woe to her, a famous city,	25
    a gay city, now forlorn!
    I will fling fires of war upon 27 Damascus’ walls, to burn up all Benhadad’s palaces.
    On Kedar and the realm of 28 Hazor, conquered by Nebuchad­rezzar king of Babylon.
    Here is the Eternal’s word:
    “Up against Kedar, ravage the Arabs!
        29 	The foe shall seize their tents
    and flocks,
    their wares, their curtains, and their camels, yelling fiercely at them, scaring them on every side.
        30 	Turn and fly far to your re­
    treats,
    inhabitants of Hazor; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
    has planned and purposed to attack you.”
        31 	The Eternal’s word is:
    “Up and attack them,
    a people at their ease, un­troubled,
    with neither gate nor bar, living remote from men;
        32 	their camels shall be your
    booty,
    their vast herds fall to you.
    I scatter to the winds the crop-haired folk, raining ruin upon them from every side,
        33 	till Hazor is a heap of ruins,
    a mere haunt of jackals; not a soul shall live there, not a man shall dwell there.”
        34 	The Eternal’s message to the prophet Jeremiah about Elam, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah.
        35 	The Lord of hosts declares:
    “I will break the bow of Elam, their mainstay;
        36 	[[hurl against Elam the four
    winds of the world and scatter them to the winds,
    till there is not a nation where no waifs from Elam come;]]
        37 	I will make Elam quail before
    their foes,
    before their murderers; raining ruin upon them, my fierce heat of anger; sending the sword after them, till they are all consumed; to pass sentence of doom, out of 38 Elam,
    on its king and on its chiefs. [[Though in the latter days 39 —so the Eternal promises—I will restore the fortunes of Elam.]]”
    The Eternal’s message fA for the prophet Jeremiah about Babylon and the land of the Chaldeans:
    Tell the nations and proclaim 3 it,
    let the news go free, that Babylon is captured, her idols are disgraced, her blocks of gods are in dis­may,
    Bel in disgrace and Marduk in dismay!
    A foe from the north has at- 3 tacked her,
    to lay waste her land, till not a man dwells there, till man and beast are gone.
    And then, says the Eternal, at 4 that hour
    the Israelites return, they and the men of Judah, wending their way weeping in search of the Eternal their God,
    asking the way to Sion,	5
    their faces turned to it, calling each other to join the Eternal
    in a lasting compact, never to be forgotten.
    My people have been lost sheep, 6 for their shepherds led them astray,
    and turned them loose on the bare hills;
    where up and down they wan­dered,
    all forgetful of the fold.
        7 	Those who caught them all de­
    voured them;
    “ ’Tis no sin,” said their foes, “for they have offended the Eternal One,
    their true Fold and their father’s Hope.”
        8 	Fly now from Babylon, leave
    Chaldea,
    lead those who leave, like he- goats.
        9 	For here am I rousing against.
    Babylon
    a horde of nations from the north,
    to battle with her mightily until they master her, shooting like expert archers, who never go empty-handed;
        10 	no, Chaldea, shall be their
    booty,
    her plunderers shall all get their fill.
        11 	Though you rejoice now and
    exult,
    you Babylonians, plundering my own people,
    though you wanton like calves at the grass,
    and neigh like lusty stal­lions,
        12 	your mother-city shall be sore
    disgraced,
    and she who bore you shall be shamed—
    left in the rear of all the na­tions,
    a land deserted, desolate, and dry;
    an empty ruin shall she lie,
        13 	under the wrath of the Eter­
    nal,
    till all whistle in horror, passing
    hy,
    appalled at all the blows that beat down Babylon.
    Set upon Babylon, all round, 14 all ye who hend the bow; spare not your arrows, shoot at her—
    she has offended the Eternal. Raise the war-cry round her— 15 she gives way, her bastions are stormed, her walls are down!
    ’Tis the Eternal’s vengeance on her;
    take your revenge, treat her as she treated others!
    Tear from Babylon every sower, 16 every reaper with his sickle; let her foreigners all flee, each scurrying home to his own land,
    to escape the sweep of the sword.
    A scattered flock is Israel,	17
    harried by lions, mauled first by the Assyrian king,
    now gnawed by Nebuchad­rezzar,
    by the king of Babylon.
    Therefore, the Lord of hosts de- 18 dares,
    the God of Israel,
    I punish Babylon, king and land, as I punished the Assyrian king;
    I bring back Israel to his home- 19 stead,
    to pasture on Karmel and Bashan,
    till he can eat his fill in Gilead and on Ephraim’s hill.
    Then, the Eternal promises, at 20 that hour,
    no guilt in Israel shall be dis­covered,
    nor any sin detected within Judah;
    for whom I spare, I pardon. Move against Merathaim, 21
    press hard the men of Pekod, slay them, devastate their land—
    so carrying out the Eternal’s own command.
        22 	Listen, there is the war-cry!
    Chaldea crashes!
        33 	What a hammering and shat­tering
    for the Hammer of the world! What a spectacle of horror has Babylon become!
    24 Aha! I have trapped you, Babylon,
    taken you unawares!
    I have tracked you, I have caught you, for defying the Eternal!
        22 	The Eternal has opened his
    arsenal
    and brought out his arms of wrath;
    for the Lord, the Lord of hosts,
    has work before him in Chal­dea.
        26 	Rush at her from every quarter,
    rifle her granaries, pile up her stores of grain, and devastate all of her, leaving no trace of her.
        27 	Slay her bulls of warriors,
    butcher every one of them! Woe betide them, their hour has come, their day of doom!
        28 	Listen to the waifs escaping
    from the land of Babylon, to tell in Sion how our God, how the Eternal has avenged his temple.
        29 	Summon archers against Baby­
    lon,
    all who bend the bow; beleaguer her, let not a man escape.
    Requite her for her crimes, treat her as she treated others—
    she and her insolence to the Eternal,
    the Majestic One of Israel!
    So shall her youth fall in the 3° open street,
    and all her warriors in death be silenced.
    I am attacking you, Queen In- 31 solence,
    says the Lord, the Lord of hosts;
    your hour has come, the day for me to doom you. Queen Insolence falls down,	32
    and her no one shall raise;
    I set her forest ablaze, till the flames shall burn her thickets.
    The Lord of hosts proclaims:	33
    “Israelites and men of Judah are trampled down together; their captors hold them fast, and will not let them go.
    But theirs is a strong champion, 34 his name the Lord of hosts; he will take their part, and daunt the Babylonians, that the world may live at peace.”
    Sword, strike the Chaldeans 35 (the Eternal orders), strike all the folk of Babylon, her nobles and her sages!
    Sword, strike the soothsayers, 36 and they shall play the fool! Sword, strike her soldiers, and they shall be in terror!
    Sword, strike her chariots and 37 horses,
    and all her foreign crowd, and they shall be weak as women!
    Sword, strike her treasures, and they shall be robbed!
    Sword, strike her streams,	38
    and they shall be dried up!
    For it is a land of images, and the folk boast of their idols;
        39 	so wolves and wildcats shall live
    there,
    ostriches shall quarter there; never shall it be tenanted, forlorn from age to age.
        40 	It shall be as when God once
    overthrew
    Sodom, Gomorrah, and the towns around; not a soul shall live there, not a man shall dwell there.
        41 	A people is coming,
    out of the north-land, a power is stirring, a host of kings,
    from the far ends of earth!
        42 	Bow and javelin they seize,
    they are cruel, pitiless; their din is like the roaring sea, they ride on horses, mustering like one man to fight you, maiden Babylon.
        43 	The king of Babylon hears the
    news,
    his hands are limp, panic seizes him, pain like a woman’s in travail.
        44 	Like shepherds when the lion
    leaves
    the jungle of Jordan for the pasture,
    I will chase them away sud­denly,
    and seize their rarest rams. Who can match me? Who dare challenge me?
    What shepherd can face me?
        45 	Hear, then, the Eternal’s plan
    against Babylon, his purpose for the Chal­deans:
    their shepherd lads shall be dragged away,
    and the farm appalled at their fate!
        46 	Earth trembles at the crash of
    Babylon’s capture,
    the noise resounds all through the nations.
    The Eternal declares:	pi
    I am stirring up destroyers O X against Babylon, against the dwellers in Chaldea;
    I am sending winnowers on 2 Babylon,
    to winnow her and leave her bare.
    Woe betide her everywhere, on her day of doom!
    Let the archer bend his bow, 3 let him stand up in his ar­mour;
    spare none of her soldiers, annihilate her army;
    strike them down within Chal- 4 dea,
    stab them in her streets;
    for their land is full of guilt 5 against His Majesty of Is­rael.
    (But Israel and Judah are not bereft
    of their God, of the Lord of
    hosts.)
    Fly from Babylon, every man 6 of you;
    save your lives, share not her doom;
    ’tis the hour of the Eternal’s vengeance,
    he is rendering her due pun­ishment.
    Once Babylon was a golden cup, 7 that made the whole world drunk;
    the nations drank her wine, and lay before her helpless.
    Suddenly Babylon falls and 8 breaks!
    Wail for the creature?
    Get balsam for her wounds— perhaps she can be cured?
    “No,” you answer, “we would 9 fain have healed her, but there is no curing Babylon;
    we must leave her to her fate, and all go home,
    for her doom rises up to heaven, reaches the very skies, io The Eternal has made good our cause;
    come, let us tell in Sion what the Eternal, our own God, has done.”
        11 	Polish your arrows,
    scour your armour— the Eternal is stirring up Media’s king,
    planning to ruin Babylon.
    This is the Eternal’s vengeance, vengeance for his temple.
        12 	Raise your standards against
    Babylon,
    blockade it round and round; post your sentries, lay your ambushes; for the Eternal executes his aim, his sentence upon Babylon.
        13 	Throned upon many a stream,
    with treasures that teem, your end has come, your web is spun!
        14 	The Lord of hosts has sworn by
    his own life,
    “I fill you full of foes, that swarm like locusts, and shout in triumph over you.”...
        20 	You have been my battle-axe;
    by you I shattered nations,
    by you I have ruined realms,
        21 	by you I shattered horse and
    rider,
    chariots and charioteers,
        22 	by you I shattered man and
    woman,
    old and young, maidens and boys,
        23 	by you I shattered flock and
    shepherd,
    ploughmen and their teams, by you I shattered satraps and regents—
        24 	yes, and (the Eternal prom­
    ises)
    I will let Sion see how I repay
    both Babylon and the Chal­deans all,
    for all the wrongs they did her.
    I strike at you, says the Eternal, 25 you volcano, ruining the world!
    I will lay hands on you and level you,
    and leave you all extinct; men will never get from you 26 any stones for building; you shall be a desolation for all time.
    Raise your standard on the 27 earth,
    blow the trumpet among the nations,
    open the campaign against her, summon the realms—Ar­menia, Mannai, Ashkenaz; muster your troops against her, cavalry swarming like locusts. Open the campaign against her, 28 with Media’s king, his satraps and his regents, and all his domain.
    All the world is trembling, 29 for the Eternal’s purpose against Babylon holds— to lay the land empty and desolate.
    Babylon’s soldiers cease to fight, 30 they stay inside their forts; their strength has gone from them,
    they are weak as women. Couriers meet, messengers meet, 31 running to tell the king of Babylon
    his city is stormed on every side,
    its houses all ablaze,	30
    the gates burst open; the ferries have been seized,	32
    the bastions burned, the troops are scared.
    For this is the sentence of the 33 Lord of hosts, the God of Israel:
    Raby/on to be trampled like a threshing-floor,
    then trampled like the grain upon the floor!
        33 	“Nebuchadrezzar king of Baby­
    lon
    has been devouring us; he set us down like an empty cup,
    he swallowed us like a mon­ster,
    he gorged himself with our de­lights,
    and then he threw us aside.
        34 	My torn flesh be avenged on
    Babylon!”—
    let those who dwell in Sion cry;
    “My blood be avenged on the Chaldeans!”— let Jerusalem cry.
        35 	And here is the Eternal’s an­
    swer:
    “I will take your part, I will avenge you,
    I will dry up her lake and drain her springs.
        36 	Babylon shall lie in ruins,
    a mere haunt of jackals, a horror and a scorn, where no man lives.”
        37 	The Babylonians all roar like
    lions,
    growling like lion-cubs over their prey?
        38 	I will feast them in my fury,
    make them drunk and stupe­fied,
    till they sleep the sleep that knows no waking;
        39 	I will drive them to the sham­
    bles,
    like sheep, like rains and goats.
        40 	What a downfall for Babylon!
    The Splendour of the world surprised!
    What horror in the world at Babylon’s fate!
    A sea has burst on Babylon, 42 she sinks below the roaring tides of war;
    her towns lie desolate,	43
    unpeopled, waterless,
    a waste where no man lives, none passes through.
    And I will punish Bel in Baby- 44 Ion,
    forcing him to disgorge his plunder;
    prisoners shall stream to him no more,
    for Babylon’s walls are down.
    Come out of her, my people, 45 save your lives, every man of you,
    from the Eternal’s burning wrath.
    Never be daunted or dismayed 46 by rumours that you hear,
    when rumours rise, year after year,
    and tyrants lord it in the land.
    For, mark this, the day comes 47 when I shall punish the idols of Babylon,
    when all her country is con­founded,
    and her inhabitants drop dead.
    Then heaven and earth and all 48 their host
    shall exult over Babylon;
    for invaders from the north- land
    shall reach her, the Eternal promises.
    Yes, Babylon shall fall, 0 slain 49 of Israel,
    as slain men have fallen everywhere for Babylon.
    You who have escaped the 50 sword,
    stay not, get away;
    remember the Eternal yonder, bethink you of Jerusalem.
    “We are ashamed,” you say, 51 “at hearing of this outrage;
    foreigners entering the sacred temple!—
    it covers us with shame.”
        52 	But, mark this, a day comes, the
    Eternal answers, when I punish the idols of Babylon,
    till wounded men groan over all the land.
        53 	Though Babylon mounted to
    the sky,
    though she entrenched her­self on high,
    yet I would speed invaders to assail her,
    the Eternal answers.
        54 	Hark! shrieks from Babylon,
    a mighty crashing in Chal­dea!
        55 	’Tis the Eternal battering down
    Babylon,
    stilling the din of her city-life! The enemy surge in like the roaring tides, shouting aloud;
        56 	for the invader has reached
    Babylon,
    her soldiers are captured, their bows all shattered.
    For the Eternal is a God of retribution,
    he never fails to punish.
    5 7 “X will make her nobles and her sages drunk, satraps and regents and sol­diers,
    till they sleep the sleep that knows no waking,” says the King called the Lord of hosts.
    58 Here is the Eternal’s sentence: “Babylon’s broad wall shall be razed,
    and her high gates burned with fire.
    So ends the toil of nations, ends in smoke,
    and pagans waste their pains.”
    Instructions given by the 59 prophet Jeremiah to Seraiah the son of Neriah, the grandson of Maliseiah, the quartermaster who accompanied Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Jere- 60 miah had written on a scroll all the evils that were to befall Babylon, and he said to Se- 61 raiah, “When you reach Baby­lon, be sure to read this all over; when you have finished, 63 tie a stone to the scroll and throw it into the Euphrates, saying, ‘So shall Babylon sink and never rise again, for the Eternal dooms it.’ ”
    Here end the words of Jere­miah.
    Zedekiah was twenty-one Cf O years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jeru­salem for eleven years; his 2 mother’s name was Hamutal, a daughter of Jeremiah from Lib- nah. He did what was evil in the sight of the Eternal, exactly as Jehoiakim had done. The 3 Eternal was so wroth that he let Jerusalem go from bad to worse, till he would have no more to do with them.
    And then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. On 4 the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of his reign Nebuchadrezzar king of Baby­lon attacked Jerusalem with all his army; they pitched camp, and ran a wall round it, be- 5 sieging the city till the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. By the 6 ninth day of the fourth month (and by this time the famine in the city was so severe that the people had no food), a breach 7 was made in the walls of the city. Seeing this, the whole garrison took to flight, leaving












    the city during the night, by the gate beside the royal gar­den, between the two walls, making their way along the Arabah, as the Chaldeans had invested the city on all sides. They made for the Jordan val-
        8 	ley. However, the Chaldean army went in pursuit of the king and overtook Zedekiah in the steppes of Jericho, his own army having all scattered and
        9 	left him. The king was cap­tured and carried off to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the district of Hamath, where sentence was passed upon him.
    xo At Riblah the king of Babylon slew Zedekiah’s sons before their father’s eyes, and also all the
        ii 	authorities of Judah; he then put out the eyes of Zedekiah, chained him fast, and carried him away to Babylon, where he lay in prison till the day of his death.
    is On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of the reign of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the commander of the body­guard, an officer of the king of Babylon, went to Jerusalem
        13 	and set fire to the temple of the Eternal, as well as the royal palace and indeed all the prin­cipal buildings in the country.
        14 	The Chaldean troops who were with him demolished the walls
        15 	of Jerusalem all round. Any people left in the city, together with those who had already sur­rendered to the king of Baby­lon, and any craftsmen who were left, Nebuzaradan the commander of the body-guard
        16 	carried away prisoners, though he left some of the very poorest people of the land to be vine-
        17 	dressers and ploughmen. The bronze columns, the trolleys,
    and the bronze tank that were in the temple, were broken up by the Chaldeans, who took all the bronze away to Babylon; they also removed the pots, the 18 shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the saucers, and any bronze 19 article used in the temple serv­ice; while the commander re­moved any gold and silver goblets, fire-pans, basins, pots, lampstands, saucers, and bowls. (The bronze was past weighing, 20 the bronze from the two col­umns, the tank, the twelve bulls supporting the tank, and the ten trolleys which king Solomon had made for the temple. Each 21 column was twenty-seven feet high, eighteen feet round, and four inches thick—hollow inside, with a bronze capital on the top, 22 seven and a half feet high, sur­rounded by a network and pomegranates in bronze, ninety- 23 six out of a hundred pome­granates in the network being visible.)
    The commander of the body- 24 guard carried off Seraiah the chief priest, Zephanlah the vice­priest, and the three wardens, along with a eunuch in charge 25 of the army, seven privy coun­cillors who were found in the city, the secretary of the com­mander, who kept the army registers, and sixty country folk whom he found within the city. Nebuzaradan the commander of 26 the body-guard took them away to the king of Babylon at Rib­lah. And there, at Riblah in 27 the district of Hamath, the king of Babylon slew them all.
    Thus was Judah carried from 28 its land into exile. The num­ber of prisoners carried off to exile by Nebuchadrezzar was as follows:	in the seventeenth
    year of his reign, three thou­
    sand and twenty-three Jews;
        29 	in the eighteenth year of Nebu­chadrezzar, eight hundred and
        30 	thirty-two from Jerusalem; in the twenty-third year of Nebu­chadrezzar, seven hundred and forty-five Jews, carried captive by Nebuzaradan the com­mander of the body-guard; in all, four thousand six hundred.
        31 	In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiakin king of Judah, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, Evil-
    merodak king of Babylon—it was the first year of his reign— took Jehoiakin king of Judah out of prison; he was civil to 32 Jehoiakin and treated him bet­ter than his fellow-monarchs in captivity at Babylon; he 33 changed his prison dress, and Jehoiakin dined with the king every day of his life. Also an 34 allowance was made for him daily by the king of Babylon, to maintain him, as long as ever he lived.
