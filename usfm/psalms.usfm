\v 1
\q1 "Happy the man who never goes by the advice of the ungodly, who never takes the sinners’ road, nor joins the company of scoffers,
\v 2
\q1 but finds his joy in the Eternal’s law, poring over it day and night.
\v 3
\q1 He is like a tree planted by a stream, that bears fruit in due season, with leaves that never fade; whatever he does, he prospers.
\v 4
\q1 Not so the ungodly! No, they are like chaff swept away by the wind;
\v 5
\q1 when judgments come, the ungodly shall not stand, nor shall the sinful last in the community of the just.
\v 6
\q1 The Eternal cares for the life of the just, but the ungodly life shall perish.
\c 2
\v 1
\q1 Why are pagans seething, nations vainly plotting,
\v 2
\q1 headed by kings of the world, by monarchs making plans
\q2 against the Eternal and his chosen one,
\v 3
\q1 crying, “Let us snap their ties,
\q2 and fling off their control”?
\v 4
\q1 Throned in heaven, he laughs,
\q2 the Lord mocks at them;
\v 5
\q1 then in wrath he speaks to them,
\q2 scares them with his fury.
\v 7
\q1 The Eternal’s edict let me tell:
\v 6
\q2 “I, I have installed my king
\q2 on Sion, on my sacred hill.”
\v 7
\q1 Let me tell the Eternal’s message:
\q2 “You are now my son,
\q2 this day am I your father;
\v 8
\q1 ask, and I make you master of pagans,
\q2 lord over all to the ends of the earth;
\v 9
\q1 you can maul them with an iron mace,
\q2 and shatter them like potter’s ware!”
\p
\v 10
\q1 So, kings, be wise;
\q2 you rulers of the world, take warning;
\v 11
\q1 worship the Eternal reverently,
\q2 shudder and submit to him,
\v 12
\q1 do homage to him truly, lest he be angry,
\q2 and you end in ruin;
\q1 for his anger quickly flames--
\q2 happy are all who shelter beside him!
\p
\s1 A song of David, when he was flying from his son Absalom.
\c 3
\v 1
\q1 How many foes have I, O thou Eternal!
\q2 Many rise against me,
\v 2
\q1 many are saying of me,
\q2 “There is no help for him in God.”
\v 3
\q1 Ah, but thou shieldest me, O thou Eternal,
\q2 in triumph, thou whom I do glorify!
\v 4
\q1 When I call out to the Eternal,
\q2 he answers me from his sacred hill.
\p
\v 5
\q1 I laid me down to sleep,
\q2 and this morning I waken, for the Eternal upholds me;
\v 6
\q1 I fear not thousands of the foe
\q2 ranged all around me.
\v 7
\q1 My enemies thou wilt all disable,
\q2 and the ungodly thou wilt crush.
\v 7
\q1 Up, O Eternal, to the rescue!
\v 8
\q1 ’Tis for the Eternal to bring help:
\q2 my God, thy blessing be upon thy people!

\v 1
\q1 O God, my champion, answer my appeal.
\q2 When I was hemmed in, thou hast freed me often;
\q2 be gracious to me now and hear my prayer.
\p
\v 2
\q1 Proud men, how long will you be so misguided,
\q2 loving to deal in libels, eager on vain intrigues?
\p
\v 3
\q1 Look how the Eternal marks me out for favour!
\q2 The Eternal listens when I call to him.
\v 4
\q1 Tremble at it and give over sinning,
\q2 bethink yourselves at night and hold your peace;
\v 5
\q2 offer true sacrifice and trust the Eternal.
\p
\v 6
\q1 Many long for a sight of prosperous days;
\q2 “Only look up and smile on us, Eternal!”
\v 7
\q1 My heart thou hast already given more joy
\q2 than theirs who harvest corn and store new wine.
\v 8
\q1 So quietly I lay me down to sleep,
\q2 for even alone, thanks to thee, I am secure.
\p
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. For flutes. A song of David.
\c 5
\v 1
\q1 O thou Eternal, listen to my words,
\q2 and hear the murmur of my soul;
\v 2
\q1 my King and God, give ear to my appeal,
\q2 for I am calling out to thee;
\v 3
\q1 oh hear my morning prayer,
\q2 for in the morning I set forth my plea,
\q2 waiting thine answer.
\p
\v 4
\q1 Thou art no God to take delight in vice,
\q2 no evil man is any guest of thine,
\v 5
\q1 no arrogance can look thee in the face;
\v 6
\q1 all wrongdoers and lying men thou hatest,
\q2 craft and bloodshed thou abhorrest;
\v 7
\q1 but I have access to thy house, by thy great generosity,
\q2 I can bow reverently before thy sacred shrine.
\p
\v 8
\q1 O thou Eternal, let not my foes thwart me,
\q2 lead thou me on, as thou art just,
\q2 make thy path smooth before me.
\v 9
\q1 For in their talk there is no truth,
\q2 their hearts are deep with mischief,
\q1 their throats are open graves--smooth-tongued deceivers!
\v 10
\q1 O God, condemn them;
\q2 let their own plots end them.
\q1 Down with them,	for	their many crimes,
\q2 rebelling against thee!
\p
\v 11
\q1 So all who shelter with thee shall rejoice,
\q2 and under thy protection sing for joy;
\q2 lovers of thy name ever exult in thee.
\v 12
\q1 For thou wilt bless the just, O thou Eternal,
\q2 shielding them safe,
\q2 crowning them with thy favour.

\c 6
\v 1
\q1 Punish me not in anger, O Eternal,
\q2 do not chastise me in hot rage;
\v 2
\q1 have pity on me, Eternal, in my weakness,
\q1 oh heal me, for my health is broken,
\v 3
\q2 my soul is in an anguish of dismay.
\p
\q1 Ah, why art thou so long of helping?
\v 4
\q1 O thou Eternal, save my life once more;
\q2 for thy love’s sake, succour me;
\v 5
\q1 for in death’s realm there is no thought of thee,
\q2 and who can praise thee in the world below?
\p
\v 6
\q1 I faint with moaning,
\q2 every night my bed is drenched with tears,
\q2 my couch is wet with them;
\v 7
\q1 trouble wears away my strength,
\q2 I age under outrages from my foes.
\p
\v 8
\q1 “Begone, all of you, evildoers!
\q2 The Eternal listens to my wail,
\v 9
\q2 the Eternal will receive my prayer.”
\v 10
\q1 My foes shall all be utterly dismayed,
\q2 and suddenly discomfited once more.
\s1 A dithyramb of David, sung to the Eternal, about the taunts of Cush the Benjamite.
\c 7
\v 1
\q1 I shelter with thee, Eternal One, my God;
\q2 keep me safe from my pursuer,
\v 2
\q1 lest he tear me like a lion,
\q2 devouring me, with none to rescue.
\p
\v 3
\q1 If I did it, Eternal One, my God,
\q2 if I am guilty of injustice,
\v 4
\q1 if I ill-treated my friend,
\q2 if I made havoc of my foe for no cause,
\p
\v 5
\q1 then let the foe chase me,
\q2 then let the foe catch me,
\q1 let him trample my life to the ground,
\q2 let him lay me low in the dust!
\p
\v 6
\q1 [[Bestir thyself in anger, O Eternal,
\q2 in outbursts of fury against our foes;
\q2 awake to aid us, to maintain the right.
\p
\v 7
\q1 Summon all nations before thee;
\q2 be seated on thy lofty throne,
\v 8
\q2 O thou Eternal, thou judge of the world!
\p
\q1 Right our cause, we are innocent,
\q2 do justice, thou, to our integrity--
\v 9
\q2 ah, end the malice of the ungodly!
\p
\q1 The God of justice reads the inmost heart;
\v 10
\q2 God shields us, he who saves io the upright heart;
\v 11
\q2 God is a just God, every day indignant.]]
\p
\v 12
\q1 There he is, whetting his sword again!
\q2 His bow is strung and stretched,
\v 13
\q1 his deadly darts are ready,
\q2 his arrows are fire-tipped;
\p
\14
\q1 the scoundrel is alive with malice,
\q2 hatching mischief and deception;
\v 15
\q1 he digs out a deep pit--
\q2 and into his own pitfall shall he tumble!
\p
\v 16
\q1 His mischief shall recoil on his own head,
\q2 his violence shall drop on his own crown;
\v 17
\q1 while I thank the Eternal for his retribution,
\q2 and praise the Eternal, the Most High.

\v 1
\q1 O thou Eternal One, our Lord,
\q2 what majesty is thine o’er all the world!
\v 2
\q1 High in heaven thou hast set thy splendour,
\v 3
\q2 to check thy foes, to crush the rebels.
\q1 Let me sing of this, thy heavenly strength,
\v 2
\q2 like tiny children lisping out thy praise;
\v 3
\q1 for, as I look up to the heavens
\q2 thy fingers made, the moon and stars that thou hast shaped,
\v 4
\q1 I ask, “And what is man, that thou should’st think of him?
\q2  is a mortal man, that thou should’st heed him?”
\v 5
\q1 Yet thou hast made him little less than divine,
\q2 hast crowned him with majesty and honour,
\v 6
\q1 giving him sway o’er all thy hands have made,
\q2  all things underneath his feet--
\v 7
\q1 sheep and oxen, all of them,
\q2 yes and the wild beasts,
\v 8
\q1 birds of the air and fish of the sea--
\q2 all that swims on the wet sea paths!
\v 9
\q1 thou Eternal One, our Lord,
\q2 what majesty is thine o’er all the world!

\c 9
\p
\v 1
\q1 With all my heart I thank q i thee, O Eternal,
\q2 I will tell over all thy deeds of wonder,
\v 2
\q1 I thrill and triumph in thee,
\q2 singing praise to thee, O thou Most High.
\v 3
\q1 For my foes are routed,
\q2 stumbling to their ruin at thy frown;
\v 4
\q1 thou hast upheld my cause, my rights,
\q2 passing just sentence, seated on thy throne;
\v 5
\q1 thou hast curbed pagans, crushing the ungodly,
\q2 blotting their very name out for all time.
\v 6
\q1 The foe is at an end, no more to be remembered,
\q2 the towns thou hast torn up lie in lasting ruin;
\v 7
\q1 but the Eternal sits enthroned for evermore,
\q2 enthroned for government,
\q1 he governs all the world with justice,
\q2 ruling its folk with equity.
\v 9
\q1 So the downtrodden are safe with the Eternal,
\q2 he is a refuge in desperate hours;
\v 10
\q1 those who know what thou art can trust in thee,
\q2 for never wilt thou abandon those who seek thee.
\p
\v 11
\q1 Sing praise to the Eternal, whose seat is in Sion,
\q2 declare to the nations what he does,
\q1 how he bears you in mind, this Avenger of bloodshed,
\q2 how he never forgets the wail of the weak.
\v 13
\q1 The Eternal has seen what I suffer, and pitied me, lifting me from the very gates of death,
\v 14
\q1 that in the gates of Sion I may chant his praise, exulting in his aid.
\v 15
\q1 The pagans have sunk in the pit they dug;
\q2 in the net they set, their feet are snared.
\v 16
\q1 The Eternal has shown what he is, by a sentence of doom,
\q2 as his hands have trapped the ungodly.
\v 17
\q1 The ungodly must go back to death,
\q2 all pagans who are forgetful of God;
\v 18
\q1 for one day the needy will be remembered,
\q2 the hopes of the downtrodden will not always be disappointed.
\p
\v 19
\q1 Take action, O Eternal, let not man have the upper hand;
\q2 let pagans get their doom from thee!
\v 20
\q1 Strike them with terror, O Eternal,
\q2 let pagans know that they are only men!
\c 10
\v 1
\q1 I A Why art thou standing so far off, O Eternal,
\q2 hiding thyself in desperate hours?
\v 2
\q1 The ungodly are haughty and harry the downtrodden--
\q2 may they be snared in their own schemes!
\v 3
\q1 The ungodly boasts of his rapacity;
\q2 the plunderer disowns, despises the Eternal;
\v 4
\q1 he thinks, in his insolence, “God never punishes”;
\q2 his thoughts amount to this, “There is no God at all”;
\v 5
\q2 the dealings of thy justice high are far beyond his sight.
\q1 Life for him is always stable;
\q2 he laughs at any who oppose him,
\v 6
\q1 thinking he can never fail,
\q2 never come to grief.
\v 7
\q1 His talk is all of perjury and craft,
\q2 mischief and injury slip from his tongue.
\v 8
\q1 He lurks round hamlets,
\q2 and murders innocent folk in secret,
\q2 ever on the outlook for the hapless;
\v 9
\q1 he lies in ambush, like a lion in his lair,
\q2 hiding to catch the weak,
\q2 to catch the weak and drag them off.
\v 10
\q1 He hunts the helpless till they drop,
\q2 unlucky victims, in his clutches.
\v 11
\q1 And he thinks, “God has forgotten,”
\q2 “He hides his face,” “He never sees.”
\v 14
\q1 But thou hast seen this misery and mischief;
\q2 thou markest it, to punish it thyself!
\q1 The hapless can leave their plight to thee,
\q2 thou Helper of the forlorn.
\p
\v 12
\q1 Take action, O Eternal, lift thy hand;
\q2 O God, forget not the afflicted.
\v 13
\q1 How dare ungodly men scorn God,
\q2 thinking that thou wilt never punish?
\v 15
\q1 Shatter the ungodly’s power,
\q2 punish his evil till there is no more.
\v 16
\q1 The Eternal reigns as king for evermore;
\q2 the pagans are gone from his land!
\v 17
\q1 Thou hearest the desire of the afflicted,
\q2 thou heedest them, thou listenest to them,
\v 18
\q1 that the forlorn and the downtrodden may have justice,
\q2 and mortal man no more may be a terror.
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\c 11
\p
\v 1
\q1 With the Eternal I take shelter;
\q2 how dare you tell me, then,
\q2 “Be off, like a bird, to the hills!
\v 2
\q1 Look, impious men bend their bow,
\q2 their arrow is on the string,
\q2 to shoot in the dark at the upright!
\v 3
\q1 The pillars of the State are falling:
\q2 what good can a just man do?”
\p
\v 4
\q1 Ah, but the Eternal is within his sacred palace,
\q2 the Eternal is enthroned in heaven,
\q2 his searching glance is upon mortal men.
\v 5
\q1 On good men the Eternal sets his stamp,
\q2 the impious who love violence he loathes;
\v 6
\q1 on impious men he showers down coals of fire,
\q2 brimstone and scorching blasts fall to their lot.
\v 7
\q1 For just is the Eternal, he loves justice;
\q2 so the upright alone enjoy his favour.
\p
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. For bass voices. A song of David.
\c 12
\p
\v 1
\q1 Help, O Eternal, goodness is no more,
\q2 fidelity has vanished from mankind!
\v 2
\q1 Empty and false are man’s words to his fellow;
\q2 they talk with flattering lips and double minds.
\v 3
\q1 The Eternal cut off every flattering lip,
\q2 and tongues that talk so loftily--
\v 4
\q1 men who declare, “We give rein to our tongues;
\q2 our lips are our own: who calls us to account?”
\p
\v 5
\q1 “The weak are being crushed, the needy sigh;
\q2 So I take action,” says the Eternal One,
\q2 “and set them safe where they long to be.”
\v 6
\q1 And what the Eternal promises is true,
\q2 sterling as silver seven times purified.
\v 7
\q1 So are we kept by thee, O thou Eternal,
\q2 safe ever from this world of men,
\v 8
\q1 where all around us the ungodly strut,
\q2 and where base creatures rise to power.
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\c 13
\p
\v 1
\q1 Eternal One, how long wilt thou forget me?
\q1 How long wilt thou withhold thy favour from me?
\v 2
\q1 How long must I cherish a daily grief?
\q1 How long is my foe to triumph over me?
\v 3
\q1 Look to me, O Eternal One, my God, and answer me;
\q1 revive me, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
\v 4
\q1 lest my foe claim, “I have mastered him,”
\q1 lest my enemies exult over my downfall.
\v 5
\q1 But on thy kindness I indeed rely;
\q1 let me exult over thy saving aid,
\v 6
\q1 let me be singing to the Eternal
\q1 for having dealt with me so lovingly.
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\c 14
\p
\v 1
\q1 Profane men think,
\q2 “There is no God!”
\q1 Depraved their lives are and detestable,
\q2 not one of them does right.
\v 2
\q1 The Eternal looks from heaven upon mankind,
\q2 to see if any have the sense to care for God.
\p
\v 3
\q1 But all are faithless,
\q2 one and all are tainted;
\q1 not one does right,
\q2 no, not a single one.
\p
\v 4
\q1 Shall they not rue it, all these rascals,
\q2 devouring my people with their extortion?
\v 5
\q1 Ha! there they are in a panic,
\q2 for God is indeed with the godly!
\v 6
\q1 You would baffle these weak folk?
\q2 But the Eternal is their resource.
\p
\v 7
\q1 Oh that Israel’s deliverance would come from Sion!
\q1 When the Eternal restores the fortunes of his people,
\q2 how Jacob will exult,
\q2 how glad will Israel be!
\s1 A song of David.
\c 15
\v 1
\q1 In thy pavilion, O Eternal, who may be a guest,
\q2 who may dwell on thy sacred hill?
\v 2
\q1 He whose life is blameless, who does right,
\q2 he whose words are from the heart--
\v 3
\q1 no scandal on his tongue, to hurt his fellow,
\q2 no insult heaped upon his neighbour;
\v 4
\q1 he has contempt for rogues,
\q2 and honours those who reverence the Eternal;
\q1 he keeps to his oath, though he may lose by it,
\v 5
\q2 he takes no interest on a loan;
\q1 he is not to be bribed against the innocent--
\q2 he, living so, shall never be rejected.
\s1 A golden ode of David.
\c 16
\p
\v 1
\q1 Keep me safe, O God, for with thee I take shelter.
\v 2
\q1 “Thou art my Lord,” I say to the Eternal,
\q2 “my welfare rests on thee alone;
\v 3
\q1 in the saints of the land, thy noble followers,
\q2 is all my delight.”
\v 4
\q1 Sorrow on sorrow is theirs, who choose some other god;
\q2 their bloody libations I will never pour,
\q2 their names I will never mention.
\v 5
\q1 Thou art what I obtain from life, O thou Eternal,
\q2 thou thyself art my share;
\v 6
\q1 fair prospects are allotted me,
\q2 a blissful heritage is mine.
\p
\v 7
\q1 I bless the Eternal for his counsel,
\q2 for teaching me during the very night:
\v 8
\q1 I keep the Eternal at all times before me;
\q2 with him so close, I cannot fail.
\v 9
\q1 And so my heart and soul rejoice,
\q2 my body rests secure;
\q1 for never wilt thou let me sink to death,
\q2 nor leave thy loyal one to the grave;
\v 4
\q1 thou wilt reveal the path to life,
\q2 to the full joy of thy presence,
\q2 to the bliss of being close to thee for ever.
\s1 A prayer of David.
\c 17
\v 1
\q1 Listen to the innocent, Eternal One, and heed our wail,
\q2 hear prayers we pour from honest lips;
\v 2
\q1 speed thy sentence in our favour,
\q2 that our eyes may see it.
\v 3
\q1 q1 For in thine equity thou hast tried our heart,
\q2 searching us out by night;
\q1 thou hast tested us and hast found nothing wrong,
\q2 no evil thought, no sin of speech;
\v 4
\q1 under thy dealings we are silent,
\q2 heeding what thou sayest;
\v 5
\q1 we have kept close to thy track,
\q2 our feet have never faltered;
\v 6
\q1 and so we call on thee, O God, to answer us;
\q2 bend thine ear, listen to our plea.
\p
\v 7
\q1 saviour, in thy kindness interpose,
\q2 those who shelter with thee from their foes;
\v 8
\q1 guard us as thine own eye,
\q2 hide us under the shadow of thy wings,
\v 9
\q1 from the ungodly who would harry us,
\q2 the eager enemies that encircle us.
\v 10
\q1 Their hearts are closed to pity,
\q2 their words are insolent;
\v 11
\q1 at every step they dog us,
\q2 alert to pull us down,
\v 12
\q1 like lions hungry to devour,
\q2 like lions lurking for their prey.
\p
\v 13
\q1 Up, O Eternal, face them, crush them;
\q2 let thy sword save us from ungodly men!
\v 14
\q1 May thy hand slay them, O Eternal,
\q2 sweeping them from the world!
\q1 Yet give them here their due of doom, sating their sons with it,
\q2 let them leave some for their children!
\v 15
\q1 But may our innocent lives enjoy thy favour,
\q2 may we be satisfied, when we wake to see thy vision.
\s1 From the Choirmaster s collection. A song of David the servant of the Eternal, who sang these words to the Eternal on the day when the Eternal rescued him from the power of all his enemies, from the power of Saul. He said:
\v 1
\q1 O Eternal, my Strength, I will exalt thee.
\v 2
\q1 The Eternal is my crag, my stronghold, my deliverer,
\q1 my God, my fortalice where I take shelter,
\q1 my shield, my saving strength, my retreat.
\v 3
\q1 The Eternal is to be praised!-- I call to him,
\q1 and I am rescued from my foes.
\v 4
\q1 For waves of death broke round me,
\q1 floods of destruction burst on me;
\v 5
\q1 deadly nets entangled me,
\q1 and fatal snares surprised me.
\v 6
\q1 I called to the Eternal in my plight,
\q1 I cried to my God for aid;
\q1  in his palace heard my voice,
\q1  cry came to his ears.
\p
\v 7
\q1 The earth was swaying, quaking,
\q1 hills were quivering to their base,
\q1 before his anger shaking;
\v 8
\q1 smoke fumed from his nostrils,
\q2 and scorching fire from his lips,
\q2 that kindled blazing coals,
\v 9
\q1 as down he came on the bending sky,
\q1 the storm-cloud at his feet.
\v 10
\q1 He rode on flying kherubs,
\q1 and swooped with the wings of the wind,
\v 11
\q1 shrouding himself in darkness,
\q1 that veiled his presence round,
\q1 with rain-clouds dark and dense.
\v 12
\q1 Storm-clouds rolled in front of him,
\q2 with hail and lightning flashes,
\v 13
\q1 and from heaven the Eternal thundered,
\q1 the Most High uttered his voice;
\v 14
\q1 he scattered his arrows,
\q1 shot twisting flashes of lightning,
\v 15
\q1 till the beds of the waters were seen,
\q1 and earth’s foundations were laid bare,
\q1 at thy storming, O Eternal,
\q1 the snorting of thy nostrils.
\p
\v 16
\q1 He reaches down to raise me,
\q1  draws me from the flood,
\v 17
\q1 he frees me from my foe so strong,
\q1 from haters far too strong for me,
\v 18
\q1 who assailed me by surprise in my distress;
\q1 but the Eternal comes to my support
\v 19
\q1 and sets me free, in a clear space;
\q1 as he delights in me, he rescues me.
\v 20
\q1 The Eternal deals with me as I am upright,
\q1 he recompenses me for my clean life;
\v 21
\q1 for I have kept to the Eternal’s road,
\q1 and never sinned by swerving from my God;
\v 22
\q1 his rules are all before my mind,
\q1 I never set aside his orders;
\v 23
\q1 I was blameless in his eyes,
\q2 and kept clear of my sins.
\v 24
\q1 So the Eternal has rewarded me
\q1 for my integrity,
\q1 for my life clean in his eyes.
\v 25
\q1 To the kind thou provest kind,
\q1 and true to the true,
\v 26

\q1 O thou Eternal, thou wilt light my lamp,
\q1 my God, thou wilt make my darkness shine;
\v 29
\q1 by thy help I can face a troop,
\q2 by God’s help I can leap a wall.
\v 30
\q1 God is unerring in his ways,
\q1 the Eternal’s promises are tried and true;
\q1 he shields all who take shelter with him.
\v 31
\q1 For who is God save the Eternal?
\q1 Who is steadfast but our God?--
\v 32
\q1 God who girdles me with strength,
\q1 and clears the path for me.
\v 33
\q1 He makes me nimble as a deer
\q1 and sets me on the height.
\v 34
\q1 He trains me how to fight,
\q1 till I can bend a bow of bronze.
\v 35
\q1 Thou hast shielded me with thine aid,
\q1 thy right hand holds me up;
\q1 thine answers to prayer have raised me.
\v 36
\q1 Thou hast given me room to move, and a foothold sure!
\v 37
\q1 I chase my foes and catch them,
\q1 I never turn till they are killed,
\v 38
\q1 I fell them till they cannot rise;
\q1 they fall down at my feet.
\v 39
\q1 For thou hast braced me for the fray;
\q1 thou makest my assailants drop before me;
\v 40
\q1 thou makest my foes fly, fly before me,
\q1 till I finish off those who hate me.
\v 41
\q1 They cry for help, but there is none to help them,
\q1 cry to the Eternal, but they get no answer;
\v 42
\q1 and I pound them to pieces like dust before the wind,
\q1 I crush them like mud in the street.
\p
\v 43
\q1 Thou hast freed me from feuds,
\q2 and made me head over pagans;
\v 44
\q1 outsiders fawn on me,
\q1 foreigners come cringing to me;
\q1 once they hear of me, they render homage;
\v 45
\q1 foreigners give way,
\q1 and creep trembling from their forts.
\p
\v 46
\q1 The Eternal is living--blest be my Might,
\q2 exalted be my God of victory!--
\v 47
\q1 God who lets me enjoy my vengeance,
\q1 subduing the nation under me.
\v 48
\q1 O thou my rescuer from my foes,
\q1 who settest me high above my enemies,
\q1 who rescuest me from violence,
\v 49
\q1 I thank thee before pagans, O Eternal,
\q1 I will sing thy praise.

\q1 Thou hast given him his heart’s desire,

\q1 be a rock of refuge for me,
\q2 a hill-fort to protect me,
\v 3
\q2 for thou art my crag and castle.
\q1 As thou art God, oh lead me, guide me,
\v 4
\q2 safe from the snares spread cunningly to catch me.
\q1 Thou art my stronghold,
\v 5
\q2 I put my life into thy hands;
\q2 and, O Eternal, O thou faithful God, thou savest me.
\v 6
\q1 Those who heed empty idols, thou wilt hate;
\q2 but in the Eternal I do put my faith.
\v 7
\q1 I will exult rejoicing in thy love,
\q2 who hast looked upon my misery
\q2 and thought of my life in adversity,
\v 8
\q1 who hast not left me in the clutches of my foes,
\q2 but hast set me at liberty.
\p
\v 9
\q1 Have pity on me, Eternal One; I am in misery,
\q2 my health is wasting under my woe,
\v 10
\q1 my life eaten away with sorrow,
\q2 and my years with sighing;
\q1 my strength gives way under my punishment,
\q2 my body falls to pieces.
\v 11
\q1 I am the scorn of all my foes,
\q2 the butt of all my fellows;
\q1 my very friends are horrified,
\q2 men shun me in the street;
\v 12
\q1 I am forgotten like a buried corpse,
\q2 flung aside like a discarded pot.
\q1 At every turn I am in terror,
\q2 for I hear many whispering,
\v 13
\q1 men making plans against me,
\q2 plotting to take my life.
\v 14
\q1 But on thee, O Eternal, I rely;
\q2 I say, “Thou art my God.”
\v 15
\q1 My fate lies in thy hands;
\q2 oh rid me of my foes and my pursuers,
\v 16
\q1 smile on thy servant,
\q2 in thy love succour me.
\v 17
\q1 On thee have I called, O Eternal,
\q2 disappoint me not;
\q2 disappoint the wicked, send them to the silent grave!
\v 18
\q1 Strike dumb these lying lips,
\q2 so insolent in pride and scorn against the just!
\p
\v 19
\q1 What wealth of kindness thou hast laid up for thy worshippers,
\q2 and shown to those who shelter with thyself!
\v 20
\q1 Thou hidest them under thy wings from human plots,
\q2 thou shelterest them from the scourge of slander!
\v 21
\q1 Blessed be the Eternal,
\q2 for wondrous favour shown me in desperate plight.
\v 22
\q1 In my distraction I cried out,
\q2 “I am cast out of thy sight!”
\q1 But thou hast heard my loud appeal,
\q2 when I called for help to thee.
\v 23
\q1 Ah, love the Eternal, all ye faithful;
\q2 the Eternal will keep faith with you,
\q2 and richly requite arrogant men.
\v 24
\q1 Only be strong, be brave,
\q2 all ye who wait for the Eternal.
\s1 An ode of David.
\c 32
\v 1
\q1 Oh the bliss of him whose guilt is pardoned,
\q2 and his sin forgiven!
\v 2
\q1 Oh the bliss of him whom the Eternal has absolved,
\q2 whose spirit has made full confession!
\v 3
\q1 So long as I refused to own my guilt,
\q2 I moaned unceasingly, life ebbed away;
\v 4
\q1 for thy hand crushed me night and day,
\q2 my body dried up, as in summer heat.
\p
\v 5
\q1 Then did I own my sin to thee,
\q2 uncovering my iniquity;
\q1 and as I vowed I would confess,
\q2 thou didst remit my sinful guilt.
\p
\v 6
\q1 So let each loyal heart in trouble pray to thee:
\q2 the floods may roar,
\q2 but they will never reach him,
\v 7
\q1 for thou wilt be his shelter,
\q2 safeguarding him in peril,
\q2 surrounding him with aid.
\p
\v 8
\q1 “I will instruct you and teach you
\q2 what is the road to take;
\q1 I will give you counsel,
\q2 O humble soul.”
\p
\v 9
\q1 Be not like mules and colts,
\q2 that do not understand the bridle,
\q1 unbroken creatures that require a halter’s curb,
\q2 or they will not come near you.
\p
\v 10
\q1 Many a pang falls to the ungodly,
\q2 but he who trusts in the Eternal shall enjoy his favour.
\q1 Exult then in the Eternal joyfully, ye just,
\q2 and shout for joy, all ye who are upright in heart.
\p
\c 33
\v 1
\q1 Rejoice, ye just, in the Eternal,
\q2 for songs of praise befit the upright soul.
\v 2
\q1 Praise the Eternal on the lyre,
\q2 sing to him on a ten-stringed lute.
\v 3
\q1 Sing him a new song,
\q2 strike the strings bravely at the festival.
\p
\v 4
\q1 For just are all the Eternal’s orders,
\q2 and all he does is loyally done;
\v 5
\q1 he has a love for honesty and justice,
\q2 the earth is full of his kindness.
\v 6
\q1 The heavens were made at the Eternal’s order,
\q2 and all their host by his mere word;
\v 6
\q1 he holds the seas as in a water-skin,
\q2 and stores up the abysses of the deep.
\p
\v 8
\q1 Let all the earth fear the Eternal,
\q2 let every dweller stand in awe of him;
\v 9
\q1 for he it was who spoke--and earth existed,
\q2 ’twas at his bidding it appeared.
\v 10
\q1 The Eternal wrecks the purposes of pagans,
\q2 he brings to nothing what the nations plan;
\v 11
\q1 but the Eternal’s purpose stands for ever,
\q2 and what he plans will last from age to age.
\v 12
\q1 Happy the nation whose God is the Eternal,
\q2 the people he has chosen for his own!
\p
\v 13
\q1 The Eternal looks from heaven,
\q2 beholding all mankind;
\v 14
\q1 from where he sits, he scans
\q2 all who inhabit the world;
\v 15
\q1 he who alone made their minds,
     he notes all they do.
\v 16
\q1 Armies do not bring victory to a king,
\q2 the warrior is not rescued by sheer strength;
\v 17
\q1 cavalry are in vain for victory,
\q2 there is no winning by the strength of that!
\v 18
\q1 No, the Eternal’s eye rests on his worshippers,
\q2 who rest their hopes upon his kindness,
\v 19
\q1 that he may rescue them from death,
\q2 and during famine-days keep them alive.
\p
\v 20
\q1 And we rest our hopes, on the Eternal,
\q2 we wait for him, our help and shield;
\v 21
\q1 in him our heart rejoices,
\q2 our faith is in his sacred name.
\v 22
\q1 Thy kindness rest on us, O thou Eternal,
\q2 as our hope rests in thee!
\s1 A song of David when he feigned madness before Abimelek, who compelled him to go away.
\c 34
\p
\v 1
\q1 I will bless the Eternal at 1 all times,
\q2 his praise shall be continually on my lips;
\v 2
\q1 my soul boasts openly of the Eternal,
\q2 and as the humble hear it, they are glad.
\v 3
\q1 Magnify the Eternal with me,
\q2 let us exalt him together.
\v 4
\q1 I besought the Eternal and he answered me,
\q2 he rescued me from all my terrors;
\v 5
\q1 look to him, and you shall beam 5 with joy,
\q2 you shall never be abashed.
\v 6
\q1 Here is a poor man whose cry the Eternal heard,
\q2 and helped him out of all his troubles.
\v 7
\q1 The angels of the Eternal camp around his worshippers,
\q2 and rescue them.
\v 8
\q1 Try the Eternal; you will find him kind;
\q2 happy the man who takes shelter with him!
\v 9
\q1 Revere the Eternal, O ye saints of his,
\q2 the reverent never want for anything;
\v 10
\q1 apostates may be famishing and starving,
\q2 but those who turn to the Eternal lack no good.
\p
\v 11
\q1 Come, listen to me, my sons,
\q2 I will teach you true religion.
\v 12
\q1 ’Tis your desire to live,
\q2 to live long and be happy?
\v 13
\q1 Then keep your tongue from evil,
\q2 keep your lips from deceit;
\v 14
\q1 shun evil and do good,
\q2 seek to be friendly--aim at that.
\v 16
\q1 For the Eternal sets his face against evildoers,
\q2 to root their very name out of the earth;
\v 15
\q1 but the Eternal turns his eyes towards good men,
\q2 his ears are open to their cry;
\v 17
\q1 when they cry, the Eternal listens,
\q2 he rescues them from all their troubles.
\v 18
\q1 The Eternal is near the brokenhearted,
\q2 and for crushed spirits he has help;
\v 19
\q1 the good man may have many a mishap,
\q2 but from them all the Eternal rescues him.
\v 20
\q1 He guards every bone of him;
\q2 not one is broken.
\v 21
\q1 Misfortune is the death of wicked men,
\q2 and haters of good men are doomed;
\v 22
\q1 but the Eternal saves his servants’ life,
\q2 none who take shelter with him shall be punished.
\s1 A song of David.
\c 35
\p
\v 1
\q1 Fight those who fight me, O thou Eternal,
\q2 war on those who war on me;
\v 2
\q1 seize thy shield and buckler,
\q2 stand up as my champion,
\v 3
\q1 draw thy spear and battle-axe,
\q2 to cope with my pursuers;
\q1 say to me, O Eternal,
\q2 “I am your safety.”
\p
\v 4
\q1 Disgraced, discomfited, be they
\q2 who seek my life!
\q1 May they be routed and confounded
\q2 who aim to injure me!
\v 5
\q1 Scattered be they like chaff before the wind,
\q2 driven by thine angel!
\v 6
\q1 Dark and slippery be their road,
\q2 pursued by thine angel!
\v 7
\q1 For wantonly they spread their net for me,
\q2 they dug a pitfall wantonly for me.
\v 8
\q1 May the net they spread ensnare themselves,
\q2 into their own pit may they fall,
\q2 surprised by ruin!
\v 9
\q1 Then shall my soul rejoice in the Eternal,
\q2 joyful at his deliverance;
\v 4
\q2 into their own pit may they fall,
\q2 surprised by ruin!
\v 9
\q1 Then shall my soul rejoice in the Eternal,
\q2 joyful at his deliverance;
\v 10
\q1 all my being shall exclaim,
\q2 “O thou Eternal, who is like thee,
\q1 O rescuer of the weak from stronger powers,
\q2 O rescuer of the wretched from destroyers!”
\p
\v 11
\q1 Malicious accusers come forward,
\q2 charging me with crimes I know naught of;
\v 12
\q1 they repay me with evil for good,
\q2 rendering me all forlorn.
\v 13
\q1 When they were ill, I wore the sackcloth,
\q2 I went humbly fasting,
\q1 I prayed for them, with head bent on my breast,
\v 14
\q2 as for a friend, as for my brother;
\q1 downcast was I, in black I dressed,
\q2 like a man mourning for his mother.
\v 15
\q1 And now, when I fall, they are glad,
\q2 and gather to attack me
\q1 with cruel, cutting charges, of which I know nothing,
\q1 railing at me unceasingly, reviling,
\v 16
\q2 mocking me, gnashing at me with their teeth!
\v 17
\q1 How long wilt thou look on at this, O Lord?
\q2 Save me from their loud lies, O thou Eternal,
\q2 save my unhappy life from human lions!
\v 18
\q1 Then shall I give thanks to thee in our assembly,
\q2 and praise thee in our throng of worshippers.
\p
\v 19
\q1 Let not my foes rejoice over me wrongfully,
\q2 let not my wanton haters wink maliciously!
\v 20
\q1 No words of peace are theirs,
\q2 but crafty plots against the peaceable;
\v 21
\q1 wide-mouthed, they are taunting me,
\q2 shouting, “Aha! aha! we see his plight!”
\v 22
\q1 Eternal One, thou seest it; keep not silence;
\q2 Lord, keep not far away;
\v 23
\q1 rouse thyself wake to do me justice,
\q2 to defend my cause, my God;
\v 24
\q1 do me justice, as thou art just thyself,
\q2 that they may never rejoice over me,
\v 25
\q1 shouting, “Aha! aha! we have our heart’s desire,
\q2 we have done for him!”
\p
\v 26
\q1 Disgraced, confounded, may they be
\q2 who delight in my harm!
\q1 Shame and dishonour cover those
\q2 who are insolent to me!
\v 27
\q1 But may they shout for joy, may they be glad,
\q2 who love to see me righted!
\q1 May they have ever cause to say,
\q2 “All hail to the Eternal,
\q2 who loves to see his servant prospering!”
\v 28
\q1 Then all day long my tongue shall talk
\q2 of thy justice and thy praise.
\s1 From, the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\c 36
\p
\v 1
\q1 An impious spirit inspires the ungodly man;
\q1 there is no fear of God before his eyes.
\v 2
\q1 He is flattering himself
\q1 that his iniquity will never be found out.
\v 3
\q1 His words are mischievous and 3 deceitful,
\q2 he has now ceased to live wisely and well;
\v 4
\q1 he plans some mischief as he lies in bed,
\q1 and then he takes a course that is not good--
\q1 he loathes not evil.
\q3 * * *
\v 5
\q1 Eternal One, thy love is high as heaven,
\q2 thy loyalty soars to the very skies,
\v 6
\q1 thy justice is like mighty mountains,
\q2 thy judgments are like the deep sea.
\q1 Thy providence is over man and beast;
\v 7
\q2 how precious is thy love, O God!
\q1 To thee men come for shelter
\q2 in the shadow of thy wings;
\v 8
\q1 they have their fill of choice food in thy house,
\q2 the stream of thy delights to drink;
\v 9
\q1 for life’s own fountain is within thy presence,
\q2 and in thy smile we have the light of life.
\p
\v 10
\q1 Continue thy love to those who care for thee,
\q2 thy justice to right-minded men.
\v 11
\q1 Never let insolence stir a foot against us,
\q2 let no ungodly hand drive us afar.
\v 12
\q1 Yonder they lie, the evildoers,
\q2 felled to the earth, unable to arise!
\s1 A song of David.
\c 37
\p
\v 1
\q1 Fret not over evildoers,
\q2 envy not the lawless;
\v 2
\q1 soon like grass they fade,
\q2 and wither like a green blade.
\p
\v 3
\q1 Trust in the Eternal and do right,
\q2 be loyal to him within his land;
\v 4
\q1 make the Eternal your delight,
\q2 and he will give you all your heart’s desire.
\p
\v 5
\q1 Leave all to him, rely on him,
\q2 and he will see to it;
\v 6
\q1 he will bring your innocence to light,
\q2 and make the justice of your cause clear as noonday.
\p
\v 7
\q1 Leave it to the Eternal and be patient;
\q2 fret not over the successful man,
\v 14
\q1 who aims to slay the upright,
\v 7
\q2 and carries out his wicked plan.
\v 8
\q1 Cease your anger, give up raging,
\q2 fret not--it only leads to evil.
\v 9
\q1 Evildoers shall indeed be rooted out,
\q2 and the land left to those who wait for the Eternal.
\p
\v 10
\q1 A little longer, and the godless will be gone;
\q2 look in his haunts, and he is there no more!
\v 11
\q1 The land will be left to the humble,
\q2 to enjoy plenteous prosperity.
\p
\v 12
\q1 The godless man makes plots against the good,
\q2 gnashing his teeth at them;
\v 13
\q1 but the Eternal laughs at him,
\q2 knowing his doom is near.
\p
\v 14
\q1 The godless draw the sword,
\q2 and bend their bows for murder;
\v 15
\q1 the sword runs into their own heart,
\q2 and their bows shall be broken!
\p
\v 16
\q1 The little that a good man has
\q2 is better than a godless man’s great wealth;
\v 17
\q1 for the arms of the godless shall be broken,
\q2 but the Eternal will protect the good.
\p
\v 18
\q1 The fortunes of the upright are the Eternal’s care,
\q2 and their possessions last for ever;
\v 19
\q1 in a calamity they keep their share,
\q2 in famine they have plenty.
\v 20
\q1 The godless perish,
\v 25
\q2 their families have to beg for food;
\v 20
\q1 the foes of the Eternal disappear like fuel,
\q2 they disappear in smoke and vanish.
\p
\v 21
\q1 The godless never pays back what he borrows,
\q2 but the good man is charitable and gives.
\v 22
\q1 Those who bless the Eternal, they shall own the land;
\q2 those who curse him shall be uprooted.
\v 23
\q1 When a man’s life pleases the Eternal,
\q2 he gives him a sure footing;
\v 24
\q1 he may fall, but he never falls down,
\q2 for the Eternal holds him by the hand.
\p
\v 25
\q1 I have been young and I am old,
\q2 but never have I seen good men forsaken;
\v 26
\q1 they always have something to give away,
\q2 something wherewith to bless their families.
\p
\v 27
\q1 Shun evil and do good,
\q2 so shall you live your life within the land;
\v 28
\q1 for the Eternal, who loves honesty,
\q2 never forsakes his faithful band.
\p
\q1 The lawless shall be utterly destroyed,
\q2 the families of the godless shall be doomed;
\v 29
\q1 the land is the possession of the good,
\q2 and all their days they shall dwell there.
\p
\v 30
\q1 The good man’s words are wise,
\q2 his talk is true;
\v 31
\q1 the Eternal’s law is in his heart,
\q2 his footsteps never falter.
\p
\v 32
\q1 The godless man spies on the good,
\q2 seeking to have them put to death;
\v 33
\q1 but the Eternal never leaves them in his power,
\q2 nor lets them be condemned when they are tried.
\p
\v 34
\q1 Wait for the Eternal, hold to him,
\v 40
\q2 and he will save you from the godless;
\v 34
\q1 he will advance you to possess the land,
\q2 and to see godless men exterminated.
\p
\v 35
\q1 I saw a godless man once on a time, a terror--
\q2 towering like any cedar of Lebanon;
\v 36
\q1 then, as I passed by, he was gone!
\q2 I looked for him--he was not to be found.
\p
\v 37
\q1 Hold to integrity, remain upright;
\q2 there is a future for the peaceable.
\v 38
\q1 But sinners shall be wiped out at a blow;
\q2 the future for the godless is perdition.
\v 39
\q1 Help comes from the Eternal to good men;
\q2 he is their refuge in the evil hour:
\v 40
\q1 the Eternal relieves them and rescues them,
\q2 because they shelter beside him.
\s1 A song of David. To be used when incense is offered.
\c 38
\p
\v 1
\q1 Punish me not in wrath, O thou Eternal,
\q2 do not chastise me in hot rage!
\v 2
\q1 Thine arrows have sunk deep in me,
\q2 thy hand is pressing hard on me.
\v 3
\q1 There is no soundness in my body,
\q2 thanks to thine indignation;
\q1 there is no health in my limbs,
\q2 thanks to my sins.
\v 4
\q1 My iniquities are overwhelming me,
\q2 crushing me like a heavy load;
\v 5
\q1 my wounds are foul and festering,
\q2 thanks to my sinful folly.
\v 6
\q1 I stagger about, bent to the ground,
\q2 all day long I go a-mourning,
\v 7
\q1 for my thighs are full of fever,
\q2 there is no soundness in my body;
\v 8
\q1 I am benumbed and badly bruised,
\q2 my moans are louder than a lion’s cry.
\p
\v 9
\q1 Lord, all my longing is well known to thee,
\q2 thou art no stranger to my sighs;
\v 10
\q1 my heart is throbbing, the pith of life has left me,
\q2 light has gone from mine eyes.
\v 11
\q1 My friends and my companions hold aloof,
\q2 my kinsmen keep away.
\v 12
\q1 Those who seek my life are setting snares,
\q2 aiming to injure me;
\q1 they talk of ruining me,
\q2 and all the day discuss intrigues.
\v 13
\q1 But, like one deaf, I never listen,
\q2 like a dumb man, I never say a word.
\v 14
\q1 [[I am like one who never hears,
\q2 who has no argument in answer.]]
\v 15
\q1 For thee, O thou Eternal, I am waiting;
\q2 thou, thou wilt answer them, O Lord my God.
\v 18
\q1 For I confess my guilt,
\q2 I sorrow for my sin.
\v 16
\q1 “Only,” I say, “let not my foes exult over me,
\q2 who are so insolent when I slip.”
\v 17
\q1 For I am on the verge of a collapse;
\q2 my plight is ever present to my mind.
\v 19
\q1 Many are they who hate me wantonly,
\q2 many are they who hate me wrongfully;
\v 20
\q1 they are returning evil for good,
\q2 they are my foes because I aim at good.
\v 21
\q1 Forsake me not, O thou Eternal,
\q2 be not far from me, O my God;
\v 22
\q1 make haste to help me,
\q2 to rescue me, O Lord.
\s1 From the Choirmaster Jeduthun’s collection. A song of David.
\c 39
\p
\v 1
\q1 I said, I will be careful what I do,
\q2 lest I sin with my tongue;
\q1 I must put a muzzle on my lips
\q2 in presence of the ungodly.
\q1 So I kept silence,
\q2 dumb and ill at ease.
\q1 Yet this only stirred my grief;
\v 3
\q2 my heart grew hot within me,
\q1 my thoughts kindled,
\q2 and I prayed aloud:
\v 4
\q1 “Oh thou Eternal, let me know my end,
\q2 the number of my days,
\q2 how long I have to live!
\v 5
\q1 Thou hast made my days no longer than a span;
\q2 my life is a mere nothing, in thy sight,
\q2 no better than an empty breath.
\v 6
\q1 Man’s busy life indeed is but a 6 phantom,
\q2 making an empty ado,
\q1 amassing wealth and knowing not
\q2 who is to have his hoard.
\v 7
\q1 What then can I expect, O Lord?
\q2 It is in thee I hope.
\v 9
\q1 I am dumb, I never say a word,
\q2 for it is thou who orderest life so.
\v 11
\q1 Thou chastenest mortal man, in punishing his guilt,
\q1 eating away his comeliness like a moth--
\q2 man is no better than an empty breath!
\v 8
\q1 Save me from all my sins,
\q2 from taunts of the profane;
\v 10
\q1 relieve me from thy plague,
\q2 for I am wasting underneath thy strokes.
\v 12
\q1 Hear my prayer, O thou Eternal,
\q2 listen to my cry,
\q2 answer thou my tears;
\q1 for I am but a guest of thine,
\q2 a passing waif,as all my fathers were.
\v 13
\q1 Avert thy frown, that I may be at ease,
\q2 ere I depart to be no more.”
\s1 From the Choirmaster's collection. A song of David.
\c 40
\p
\v 1
\q1 As patiently I waited for the Eternal,
\q2 he turned and listened to my cry;
\v 2
\q1 he raised me from a lonesome pit, a muddy bog,
\q2 he set my foot on a rock and steadied my steps,
\v 3
\q1 putting a new song in my mouth,
\q2 a song of praise to our God,

\q1 Were I to tell them, to recount them,
\q2 they would pass all count.
\p
\q1 Thou carest not for sacrifice and offering,
\q2 for no burnt-offering or sin- offering is thy demand.
\q1 An open ear thou gavest me;
\v 7
\q2 I answered, “Here I come
\q2 to do thy bidding in the Book;

\q1 to please and serve thee is my joy
\q2 thy law lies deep within my heart.”

\q1 O God, we have heard with our ears,
\q2 our fathers have told us the tale,
\q2 of thy doings in ancient years,
\v 2
\q2 how thou didst plant them, evicting the pagans,
\q2 how thou didst shatter the nations and scatter them.
\v 3
\q1 For the land was not won by the sword of our fathers,
\q2 nor the victory gained by their arm;
\q1 thine was the hand and the arm,
\q2 thine was the favour that smiled on them;
\v 4
\q1 my King, my God, it was thou
\q2 by whose command Jacob was conqueror!
\v 5
\q1 By thee we can thrust down our foe,
\q2 by thee we can crush our attackers;
\v 6
\q1 for I rely not on my bow,
\q2 ’tis not my sword that wins the battle;
\v 7
\q1 from thee the victory comes to us,
\q2 the humbling to our haters;
\v 8
\q1 all day it is of God we boast,
\q2 unceasingly we praise thee.
\p
\v 9
\q1 And yet thou hast discarded us in disgrace;
\q2 thou wilt not march with our armies,
\v 10
\q1 thou makest us fly from the foe,
\q2 till our haters plunder us at pleasure;
\v 11
\q1 thou lettest us be eaten up like sheep,
\q2 thou scatterest us among the pagans,
\v 12
\q1 selling thy people cheap,
\q2 for a poor price--no profit to thyself!
\v 13
\q1 Thou makest us the butt of our neighbours,
\q2 a scorn and a derision to all around,
\v 14
\q1 a byword among pagans,
\q2 jeered at by the nations;
\v 15
\q1 all day long the disgrace is before me,
\q2 the shame of it overclouds me,
\v 16
\q1 at the sound of the taunters and scoffers,
\q2 at the sight of the vengeful foe.
\p
\v 17
\q1 All this has come upon us,
\q2 yet never have we forgotten thee,
\q2 never proved false to thy bond;
\v 18
\q1 our heart has never flinched,
\q2 our steps have never swerved from thine own road,
\v 19
\q1 that thou should’st so crush us,
\q2 and plunge us into deathly gloom,
\q2 where jackals howl.
\v 20
\q1 If we had forgotten the name of our God,
\q2 or appealed to a foreign god,
\v 21
\q1 would not God have found it out?
\q2 He knows the very secrets of the heart.
\v 22
\q1 But no, ’tis for thy sake we are killed all day,
\q2 counted no better than sheep to be slaughtered.
\v 23
\q1 Bestir thyself, Eternal One! Why sleep?
\q2 Awaken! ah, discard us not for ever!
\v 24
\q1 Why art thou hiding thy face,
\q2 forgetful of our woe and our distress?
\v 25
\q1 For our soul is bowed to the dust,
\q2 our body lies low on the ground.

\q1 Success to you, as you ride forth

\q2 and boast of their abounding wealth?

\q1 Why, none can buy himself off;
\q2 not one can purchase for a price from God
\v 8
\q1 soul’s ransom is too dear

\q2 life that shall never end.
\p
\v 10
\q1 What! “Never die?” but die they must--
\q2 men of sense have to die,
\q1 stupid and senseless perish,
\q2 leaving their wealth to others;

\q1 their home eternal is the grave below,
\q2 a dwelling where they must remain;
\q1 they vanish from men’s memory, although
\q2 they claimed lands for their own.

\q1 For all the splendour that they cherish,
     men pass, even as the beasts that perish.
\v 13
\q1 Such is the fate of the self-satisfied,
     the end of all whose faith is in themselves;
\v 14
\q1 death shepherds them unchecked,
\q2 driving them down to the world below;
\q1 ere long their form and fashion waste away,
\q2 and they abide within the world below.
\v 15
\q1 (But God can ransom me;
\q2 he will release me from the grasp of death.)
\v 16
\q1 So fear not when a man grows rich,
\q2 and when the splendour of his house increases;
\v 17
\q1 he can take nothing with him when he dies,
\q2 his splendour will not follow him below.
\v 18
\q1 In life he flatters himself on his fortune,
\q2 praising himself for his prosperity;
\v 19
\q1 but down he goes to where his fathers dwell,
\q2 who see no light to all eternity.

\q2 your mouths are weaving malice,
\v 20
\q1 as you sit and malign your brother,
\q2 slandering the son of your own mother.
\v 21
\q1 This you have done--and because I said nothing,
\q2 you thought I was no better than yourself!
\q1 But I will now convict you,
\q2 I will put it to you plainly.
\v 22
\q1 Mark this, you who ignore me,
\q2 or I will tear you to pieces,
\q2 with none to protect you:

\q2 he honours me;

\q2 when thou didst move across the steppes,
\v 8
\q1 earth was quaking, the skies shaking,
\q2 before God, Israel’s God.
\v 9
\q1 O God, thou didst pour down a generous rain,
\q2 reviving thy land as it languished;
\v 10
\q1 thy household were settled there,
\q2 and in thy goodness thou didst meet their needs.
\p
\v 11
\q1 When the Lord sent news of n victory,
\q2 the women who told it were a mighty host:
\v 12
\q1 “Kings and their armies are flying, are flying!--
\q2 their spoil is divided
\q2 by Israel the fair Dove at home,
\v 13
\q1 till her wings are covered with silver,
\q2 her pinions shimmer in gold.
\v 14
\q1 When the kings were routed on the field,
\q2 ’twas like snow falling on mount Zalmon.”
\p
\v 15
\q1 A mighty range is Bashan range;
\q2 Bashan range has many a peak.
\v 16
\q1 But what is your grudge, O range of peaks,
\q2 at the hill that God loves for his home,
\q2 where the Eternal dwells for evermore?
\v 17
\q1 With mighty chariots in their myriads
\q2 the Eternal came from Sinai to this sanctuary.
\v 18
\q1 There didst thou triumph, with captives in thy train,
\q2 with tribute taken from men--
\q2 only the rebels dwell not there with God.
\p
\v 19
\q1 Blessed be the Lord, our saving God,
\q2 who daily bears the burden of our fife;
\v 20
\q1 God is for us a God of victories,
\q2 thanks to the Eternal we escape from death;
\v 21
\q1 yes, God will shatter the head of his foes,
\q2 each long-haired sinner who defies him.
\v 22
\q1 The Lord’s word is, “Wherever you may be,
\q2 I bring you from Bashan, from the sea,
\v 23
\q1 to bathe your feet in the blood of the foe,
\q2 and let your very dogs share, as they lap it.”
\p
\v 24
\q1 Behold God entering the sanctuary,
\q2 my God, my King, in high procession,
\v 25
\q1 singers in front, musicians behind,
\q2 between them girls with tambourines,
\v 26
\q1 singing, “Bless the Lord God in your choirs,
\q2 O Israel’s offspring!”
\v 27
\q1 In front the Benjamites, so few,
\q2 the chiefs of Judah, a great company,
\q2 the chiefs of Zebulun and Naphtali!
\v 29
\q1 From thy temple high above Jerusalem,
\v 28
\q2 display thy strength, O God,
\q1 who hast so mightily prevailed for us;
\v 29
\q2 there kings must offer thee tribute.
\v 30
\q1 Check that Brute of a Nile-power,
\q2 the bullocks and steers of pagans;
\q1 trample down crafty policy,
\q2 rout all the races that rejoice in war,
\v 31
\q1 till even Egypt sends ambassadors,
\q2 and Ethiopia hurries to submit to God.
\p
\v 32
\q1 Sing to God, O kingdoms of the world,
\q2 oh celebrate the Lord!
\v 33
\q1 Praise him who rides high on the ancient heavens,
\q2 whose voice thunders aloud.
\v 34
\q1 Praise God for his might,
\q2 whose sovereign sway is over Israel,
\q2 whose might is in the skies.
\v 35
\q1 God strikes awe from his sanetuary,
\q2 the God of Israel who bestows
\q2 prowess and power on people blessed by God.

\q1 Save me, O God,
\q2 for the waters are threatening my life;
\v 2
\q1 I am sinking deep in the mud,
\q2 where foothold there is none,
\q1 I have fallen into waters deep,
\q2 floods o’er me sweep.
\v 3
\q1 I am wearied with crying,
\q2 my throat is parched,
\q1 mine eyes are weak
\q2 with waiting for my God.
\v 4
\q1 I have more men who hate me wantonly
\q2 than hairs upon my head;
\q1 my murderous, false foes are more
\q2 than the bones within my body;
\q1 they force me to repay
\q2 what I never extorted.
\v 5
\q1 O God, though well thou knowest my sinful folly,
\q2 although no fault of mine is hid from thee,
\v 4
\q1 may naught befall me that would disconcert
\q2 those who wait for thee, O Lord God of hosts;
\q1 may naught befall me that would disappoint
\q2 thy worshippers, O God of Israel.
\p
\v 7
\q1 ’Tis for thy sake that I have suffered taunts,
\q2 had insults cover me with shame,
\v 8
\q1 till my own brothers held aloof from me,
\q2 even my mother’s sons were distant to me.
\v 9
\q1 ’Tis zeal for thy house that wears me away,
\q2 and taunts against thee fall on me.
\v 10
\q1 when I chastened my soul with fasting,
\q2 men jeered at me;
\v 11
\q1 when I clothed myself in sackcloth,
\q2 I became their byword;
\v 12
\q1 men make a jest of me in public,
\q2 they put me into their maudlin songs.
\p
\v 13
\q1 But as for me, I pray to thee;
\q2 in thy great generosity, O God, do thou accept me;
\q2 answer me with thy loyal aid,
\v 14
\q1 save me from sinking in the mud,
\q2 from the deep waters of hatred--
\v 15
\q1 let not the flood sweep over me,
\q2 let not the depths drown me;
\q2 let not death close over me.
\v 16
\q1 Answer me, O Eternal, in thy love,
\q2 in thy vast pity turn to me;
\v 17
\q1 hide not thy face from thy servant,
\q2 answer me quickly, for I am in misery;
\v 18
\q1 come to me, rescue my life,
\q2 set me in safety from my foes.
\v 19
\q1 Thou knowest how I am taunted, shamed, dishonoured,
\q2 my foes are plain to thee;
\v 20
\q1 their taunts have broken my heart,
\q2 I am sick to the soul;
\q1 I look for pity--there is none,
\q2 for comforters, but all in vain.
\v 21
\q1 For food men hand me poisonous drugs,
\q2 and vinegar when I would drink.
\p
\v 22
\q1 May the table they spread be their own ruin,
\q2 may their offerings ensnare them,
\v 23
\q1 may their eyes be blurred aDd blind,
\q2 may their thighs be all a-quiver!
\v 24
\q1 Vent thine anger on them,
\q2 may thy burning fury seize them,
\v 25
\q1 desolate be their dwellings,
\q2 empty be their tents,
\v 26
\q1 for persecuting him whom thou hast punished,
\q2 and adding to the pain thy wounds inflict!
\v 27
\q1 Punish them for their crime,
\q2 exclude them from thy favours,
\v 28
\q1 blot them from the Book of life,
\q2 blot their name from the list of the upright!
\p
\v 29
\q1 But lift me safe, O God,
\q2 out of my pain and misery,
\v 30
\q1 and then I will sing praise to God,
\q2 and magnify him with thanksgiving;
\v 31
\q1 ’twill please the Eternal more than any bull,
\q2 or any bullock that has horns and hoofs.
\v 32
\q1 Mark all this and be glad, O folk forlorn,
\q2 take heart, O worshippers of God;
\v 33
\q1 the Eternal listens to a life in need,
\q2 he never overlooks his own in prison.
\v 34
\q1 Praise to him from heaven and earth,
\q2 from seas and all that glide therein!
\v 35
\q1 For God will succour Sion
\q2 and rebuild the towns of Judah,
\q2 till men dwell there and own them,
\v 36
\q1 till his servants leave them to their children,
\q2 and a race who love him live there.

\q2 Routed, dishonoured, be they who delight in harm to me!

\v 4
\q1 But gladly may thy followers all rejoice in thee!
\q2 May those who love thy saving help have ever cause to say, “All hail to God!”

\q1 Thou art my help and my deliverer;

\v 4
\q1 O my God, rescue me from evil men,

\q1 for thou art my hope, O Lord,
\q2 I have trusted thee from youth,

\q2 my hope is ever in thee.
\v 7
\q1 Through thee, my strength and shelter,
\q2 I am a marvel to many;

\q1 my lips shall be full of thy praise,

\q1 “Set on him, seize him, God has forsaken him,

\v 12
\q1 O God, be not far from me,

\v 13
\q1 May all my enemies be disgraced, defeated,
\q2 may insults and dishonour cover all who would injure me!
\v 14
\q1 As for me, I hope on and on,
\q2 I praise thee more than ever;
\v 15
\q1 all day long I will be telling
\q2 of thy victorious and faithful aid,
\q2 though never can I tell it to the full;
\v 16
\q1 I will recite the great deeds of the Lord,
\q2 and praise thy faithful aid--and only thine.
\v 17
\q1 Thou hast been teaching it from my youth, O God,
\q2 and I have ever told thy wondrous deeds.
\v 18
\q1 Forsake me not, O God,
\q2 when I am old and grey;
\q1 that I may tell the rising generation

\v 20
\q1 Many a trial sore
\q2 hast thou made us suffer,
\q1 but thou wilt revive us once more
\q2 and raise us from the depths;
\v 21
\q1 thou wilt add to our honour,
\q2 and comfort us once more.
\v 22
\q1 So shall I praise thee on the lute
\q2 for loyalty to me, my God,
\q1 singing thy praises on the lyre,
\q2 Majestic One of Israel.
\v 23
\q1 My lips shall ring with joy and praise,
\q2 even the life which thou hast saved;
\v 24

\q1 Justice and welfare flourish in his days,

\v 8
\q1 From sea to sea may his domain extend,
\q2 from the Euphrates to the earth’s far end!
\v 9
\q1 May the foe bow down before him,

\v 10
\q1 May kings of the west and the seaboard
\q2 pay tribute to him,
\q1 may kings of the south and of Arabia
\q2 offer him presents,
\v 11
\q1 all kings do homage to him,
\q2 all nations yield to him!
\v 12
\q1 For he saves the forlorn who cry to him,

\p
\v 1
\q1 Yes, to the upright God is good,
\q2 to hearts unstained!
\p
\v 2
\q1 I almost slipped,
\q2 I nearly lost my footing,
\v 3
\q1 in anger at the godless and their arrogance,
\q2 at the sight of their success.
\v 4
\q1 No pain is theirs,
\q2 but sound, strong health;
\v 5
\q1 no part have they in human cares,
\q2 no blows like other men.
\v 6
\q1 So they vaunt them in their pride,
\q2 and flaunt them in rough insolence;
\v 7
\q1 vice oozes from their very soul,
\q2 their minds are rank and riotous,
\v 8
\q1 their talk is mocking and malicious.
\q2 and haughtily they lay their plots;
\v 9
\q1 lofty as heaven itself their speech,
\q2 lording it over the world below.
\v 10
\q1 So people turn to follow them,
\q2 and see no wrong in them,
\v 11
\q1 thinking, “What does God care?
\q2 How can the Almighty heed--when these,
\v 12
\q1 the godless, prosperously fare,
\q2 thriving thus at their ease?
\v 13
\q1 ’Tis all in vain I kept my heart from stain,
\q2 kept my life clean,
\v 14
\q1 when all day long blows fell on me,
\q2 and every dawn brought me some chastening!
\p
\v 15
\q1 Yet, had I meant to utter this aloud,
\q2 I had been faithless to thy family.
\v 16
\q1 So I thought of it, thinking to fathom it;
\q2 but sorely did it trouble me,
\v 17
\q1 till I found out God’s secret,
\q2 viewing their latter end.
\v 18
\q1 Thou plantest them on slippery ground,
\q2 thou hurlest them to ruin--
\v 19
\q1 laid low in a single moment,
\q2 scared away, swept away,
\v 20
\q1 like a dream when one awakens,
\q2 like phantoms despised by the day!
\p
\v 21
\q1 When my heart was sour
\q2 when I felt sore,
\v 22
\q1 I was a dull, stupid creature,
\q2 no better than a brute before thee.
\v 23
\q1 Yet I am always beside thee;
\q2 thou holdest my right hand,
\v 24
\q1 guiding me with thy counsel,
\q2 leading me after thyself by the hand.
\v 25
\q1 Whom have I in heaven but thee?
\q2 On earth I care for nothing else.
\v 26
\q1 Body and soul may fail,
     but God my strength is mine, my own for evermore.
\v 27
\q1 Those who leave thee are lost;
     all who are faithless to thee, thou destroyest.
\v 28
\q1 But to be near God is my bliss,
\q2 to shelter with the Lord
\q2 [[that I may tell of all thy works]].

\q1 whom thou didst rescue to be thine own people,
\q1 this hill of Sion, thine abode.
\v 3
\q1 Turn thy steps toward the standing ruins,
\q1 to all the havoc of the foe within the sanctuary.
\p
\v 4
\q1 Thine enemies bawled inside thy house,
\q1 set up their emblems there;
\v 5
\q1 they smashed the doors down with their axes,
\q1 like woodmen felling trees,
\v 6
\q1 then broke up all the carved work there
\q1 with hatchet and with hammer;
\v 7
\q1 they set thy sanctuary ablaze,
\q1 laying it low, profaning thine own dwelling.
\v 8
\q1 They said to themselves, “Let us root them out!”
\q1 so all the synagogues in the land they burned;
\v 9
\q1 not an emblem of ours is to be seen.
\q1 No prophet now--none knows when this will end!

\q1 Why hold back thy hand, On God?
\q1 Stretch out thy right hand and strike,
\v 12
\q1 thou who art our King of old,
\q1 gaining victories on earth!
\v 13
\q1 Thou didst divide the ocean by thy power,
\q1 shattering the Dragon’s heads upon the waves,
\v 14
\q1 crushing the heads of Leviathan to pieces,
\q1 leaving him a prey to jackals.
\v 15
\q1 Thou didst open springs and torrents,
\q1 thou didst dry up flowing streams;
\v 16
\q1 thine is the day and thine the 16 night,
\q2 thou hast provided sun and starlight;
\v 17
\q1 thou hast arranged the earth in its due order,
\q2 thou hast made summer and winter.
\p
\v 18
\q1 Thou to be scoffed at by foes, O Eternal!
\q2 Thou for an impious race to blaspheme!
\v 19
\q1 Leave not thy Dove Israel to a brutal power;
\q2 forget not thy poor people for all time.
\v 20
\q1 Look at these creatures, so sleek and successful!--
\q2 every corner is full of their violence.
\v 21
\q1 Let not the downtrodden turn from thee disappointed,
\q2 but may the weak and wretched have good cause to praise thee!
\v 22
\q1 Up, O God, to vindicate the cause that is thine own!
\q2 Remember how the impious scoff at thee all day long;

\q2 lightning lit up the world,
\q2 earth shook and was confounded,
\v 19
\q1 as thou didst tread upon the sea,
\q2 marching through deep waters
\q2 thy footprints all unseen.”
\s1 An Asaphite ode.
\c 78
\p
\v 1
\q1 Listen to my teaching, 1 my people,
\q2 give ear to what I say,
\v 2
\q1 as I open my lips in a poem
\q2 on deep lessons of the past
\v 3
\q1 that we know as we have heard,
\q2 that our fathers told to us,
\v 4
\q1 hiding it not from their children,
\q2 but telling the next generation
\q1 the Eternal’s praise and power,
\q2 the wonders he has done.
\p
\v 5
\q1 He set up his witness in Jacob,
\q2 he appointed a law within Israel,
\q1 bidding our fathers instruct their children,
\v 6
\q2 that the next generation might understand
\q1 that children yet unborn might rise
\q2 and tell their children after them,
\v 7
\q1 to put their confidence in God,
\q2 and not forget the deeds of God,
\q2 but loyally obey him;
\v 8
\q1 that they might not be like their fathers,
\q2 a stubborn and unruly race,
\q1 a wavering race--
\q2 no loyal hearts for God.
\p
\v 9
\q1 The Ephraimites were like a disappointing bow,
\q2 that fails upon the day of battle;
\v 10
\q1 they would not hold to their compact with God,
\q2 they would not follow his directions,
\v 11
\q1 they forgot what he had done,
\q2 the wonders he had shown them.
\v 12
\q1 Marvels he wrought, under their fathers’ eyes,
\q2 in Egypt, in the land of Zoan;
\v 13
\q1 he split the sea and led them through,
\q2 piling the water up like walls,
\v 14
\q1 he led them with a cloud by day,
\q2 and all night with a blazing fire;
\v 15
\q1 he split rocks in the wilderness,
\q2 to give them a flow of drink in the desert,
\v 16
\q1 he brought streams out of the rock,
\q2 made water run like a river.
\v 17
\q1 But still they sinned against him, in the desert
\q2 they defied the Most High;
\v 18
\q1 with a doubt of God in their mind,
\q2 they demanded the food they craved,
\v 19
\q1 they questioned God--was he able
\q2 here in the desert to spread us a table?
\v 20
\q1 He struck the rock till waters flowed
\q2 and streams poured out;
\q1 but can he give us food as well,
\q2 and furnish flesh to his peo- ple?
\v 21
\q1 When the Eternal heard this, he was wroth,
\q2 he blazed out against Jacob,
\q2 his wrath broke upon Israel,
\v 22
\q1 for failing to believe in God,
\q2 for trusting not his saving aid.
\v 23
\q1 So, at his bidding, from the skies,
\q2 as he opened the sluices of heaven,
\v 24
\q1 manna rained down for their food,
\q2 and he gave them heaven’s own grain;
\v 25
\q1 men ate the bread of angels,
\q2 he sent them food to the full.
\v 26
\q1 He brought an east wind over the sky,
\q2 he drove a strong wind from the south,
\v 27
\q1 raining flesh on them like the dust,
\q2 and birds like sand upon the beach,
\v 28
\q1 that dropped inside the camp,
\q2 close to their very tents.
\v 29
\q1 They ate, and they were gorged then with
\q2 the food they craved;
\v 30
\q1 and still they were at their surfeit,
\q2 still eating up their food,
\v 31
\q1 when the anger of God broke on them
\q2 and slew their lusty men,
\q2 laying the pick of Israel low.
\p
\v 32
\q1 Yet on they went in sin;
\q2 for all his wonders, they would not believe.
\v 33
\q1 So he made their days brief as a breath,
\q2 and the end of their life sudden death.
\v 34
\q1 Then, if he slew them, they sought after him,
\q2 they would earnestly seek God again,
\v 35
\q1 remembering God was their strength,
\q2 and God Most High their preserver.
\v 36
\q1 But it was smooth words and no more,
\q2 their promises to him were false;
\v 37
\q1 they had a wavering mind,
\q2 they were not loyal to his compact.
\p
\v 38
\q1 He in his great pity cancels sin,
\q2 dooms not to death;
\q1 often he will avert his wrath,
\q2 without one angry breath.
\v 39
\q1 So he remembered they were mortal men,
\q2 their life no better than a passing breeze;
\v 40
\q1 though often they defied him in the desert,
\q2 and vexed him in the wilderness,
\v 41
\q1 with doubts of God again and again,
\q2 that pained the Majestic One of Israel.
\v 42
\q1 They remembered not his power,
\q2 nor the day he saved them from the foe,
\v 43
\q1 the portents that he wrought in Egypt,
\q2 his marvels in the land of Zoan;
\v 44
\q1 how he turned streams into blood,
\q2 till none could drink the water,
\v 43
\q1 sent out swarms of dog-flies to devour,
\q2 frogs to destroy,
\v 46
\q1 let caterpillars have the crops,
\q2 and locusts all the fruit of the foe’s labour;
\v 47
\q1 he killed their vines with hail,
\q2 the sycomores with frost,
\v 48
\q1 gave cattle over to the plague,
\q2 and beasts to the murrain.
\v 49
\q1 His blazing anger he let loose,
\q2 fury and rage and ruin,
\q2 the messengers of woe;
\v 50
\q1 straight and swift his anger sped, unsparing,
\q2 letting the deadly pestilence prey on life;
\v 51
\q1 he struck down all the firstborn within Egypt,
\q2 each oldest male child in the tents of Khem.
\v 52
\q1 But his own people he led out like sheep,
\q2 guiding them in the desert like a flock;
\v 53
\q1 he led them safely on, past any fear,
\q2 when the sea drowned their foes;
\v 54
\q1 he brought them to his sacred soil,
\q2 to hills he had won for himself;
\v 55
\q1 he drove out nations before them,
\q2 and duly divided their land,
\q2 for Israel’s clans to occupy.
\p
\v 56
\q1 Yet they doubted and defied the Most High God,
\q2 they would not obey his rules;
\v 57
\q1 they fell back, false like their fathers,
\q2 they failed, like a disappointing bow;
\v 58
\q1 their idols angered him upon the heights,
\q2 their images provoked his jealousy.
\v 59
\q1 God heard of it, and he was furious--
\q2 he was done with Israel!
\v 60
\q1 He abandoned his Dwelling at Shilo,
\q2 the tent he had pitched among men,
\v 61
\q1 he let his great ark be captured,
\q2 let his splendid ark fall to the foe;
\v 62
\q1 he abandoned his folk to the edge of the sword,
\q2 so furious was he with his own,
\v 63
\q1 till their youth fell in the flames of war,
\q2 and girls had never a wedding song,
\v 64
\q1 till their priests were cut to pieces,
\q2 and widows dared not raise a dirge.
\p
\v 65
\q1 Then the Lord started up, as from a sleep,
\q2 and, like a hero wild with wine,
\v 66
\q1 he made rout of his foes,
\q2 defeating and disgracing them for ever;
\v 67
\q1 and then, disowning the tents of Joseph,
\q2 passing by Ephraim’s clan,
\v 68
\q1 he chose the clan of Judah,
\q2 his beloved hill of Sion,
\v 69
\q1 where he built his shrine like heaven on high,
\q2 firm as the earth he has founded for ever.
\v 70
\q1 He chose his servant David,
\q2 took him from the sheep-folds,
\v 71
\q2 fetched him from the care of ewes,
\q1 to tend his people Jacob,
\q2 to shepherd his own Israel;
\v 72
\q1 and he did tend them honestly,
\q2 he led them with ability.

\q1 O God, the pagans have invaded thy preserve,
\q2 thy sacred shrine they have profaned,
\q2 Jerusalem have they laid in ruins;
\v 2
\q1 they have flung the corpses of thy servants
\q2 to wild birds as their food,
\q2 the flesh of thy followers to wild beasts;
\v 3
\q1 all round Jerusalem
\q2 their blood has been poured out like water,
\q2 and there was none to give them burial.
\p
\v 5
\q1 Eternal One, how long wilt thou be angry?
\q2 Is thy passion to burn on for ever,
\q2 like a fire, against us?
\v 6
\q1 Vent thy rage on pagans who disown thee,
\q2 on realms that never invoke thee,
\v 7
\q2 who devour Jacob and lay waste his homestead.
\v 8
\q1 Remember not our fathers’ sins against us;.
\q2 let thy compassion hasten to our need,
\q2 for we are low indeed.
\v 9
\q1 Help us, O God our saviour,
\q2 for the sake of thine own honour,
\q2 and cancel thou our sins;
\q1 rescue us, as thou art God,
\v 10
\q2 for why should pagans sneer,
\q2 “Where is their God?”
\q1 Oh may we live to see
\q2 thy vengeance fall on pagans,
\q2 for spilling the blood of thy servants!
\v 11
\q1 Oh may the moan of prisoners reach thee,
\q2 and by thy mighty power
\q2 release those who are doomed to die.
\v 12
\q1 Pay back our neighbours, Lord,
\q2 punish them seven times over for the taunts
\q2 that they have heaped on thee.
\v 13
\q1 Then we thy people, the sheep of thy pasture,
\q2 will ever give thee thanks,
\q2 and to all ages tell thy praise.

\q1 O Lord of hosts, how long will thine anger fume,
\q2 though thy people are praying?

\q1 Thou didst bring a vine from Egypt,
\q2 thou didst plant her, driving out the nations;

\q1 when thou didst clear a place for her,
\q2 she took root and she spread over the land,
\v 10
\q1 till her shadow lay over the mountains,
\q2 and her boughs covered even the mighty cedars;
\v 11
\q1 she pushed her tendrils to the sea,
\q2 her shoots to the Euphrates.
\v 12
\q1 Why hast thou torn her fences down,
\q2 till passers-by all strip her,
\v 13
\q1 till the boar from the forest gnaws her,
\q2 and wild beasts graze on her?
\v 14
\q1 O God of hosts, we pray thee,
\q2 look once again from heaven, look on her;
\v 15
\q1 take this vine, thy charge, replant her,
\q2 this the vine thy right hand planted.
\v 16
\q1 Men have burned her, cut her down--
\q2  they perish at thy frown!
\v 17
\q1 Do thou protect thy chosen folk,
\q2 those thou hast nurtured for thyself;
\v 18
\q1 then shall we never be faithless to thee;
\q2 revive us, and we will worship thee.

     * * *
\q1 I heard one whom I knew not, saying:
\v 6
\q1 I freed your shoulder from the load,
\q2 your hands from the heavy hod;
\v 7
\q1 at your cry of distress I rescued you,
\q2 I answered you from thunderclouds,
\q2 I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
\v 8
\q1 Listen, my people, to my warning--
\q2 O Israel, if you would only listen:
\v 9
\q1 you must allow no foreign god,
\q2 no worship of an outside god;
\v 10
\q1 I am your God, I the Eternal,
\q2 who brought you out of Egypt’s land;
\q2 open your mouth and I will fill it.
\p
\v 11
\q1 But my people would not listen,
\q2 Israel would have none of me;
\v 12
\q1 so I left them to their own selfwill,
\q2 to follow their own devices.
\v 13
\q1 Oh that my people would listen to me,
\q2 that Israel would live my life!
\v 14
\q1 I would soon subdue their foes,
\q2 and strike at their oppressors;
\v 15
\q1 those who hate them would cower before them,
\q2 in unending terror;

\v 15
\q1 Ever since youth I have suffered and languished,
\q2 crushed by the dread of thee, I faint;
\v 16
\q1 thy burning wrath sweeps over me,
\q2 thy terrors have undone me,
\v 17
\q1 surging round me all day long,
\q2 closing round on every side.
\v 18
\q1 Thou hast put far every friend,
\q2 and darkness is my one companion.
\s1 An ode of Ethan the Ezrahite.
\c 89
\p
\v 1
\q1 I will sing always of the Eternal’s love,
\q2 telling all ages of thy faithfulness;
\v 2
\q1 for thy love thou hast promised to be lasting,
\q2 thy faithfulness is firmly fixed in heaven,
\v 5
\q1 and heaven is praising, O Eternal, heaven’s own host,
\q2 the marvel of thy faithfulness.
\v 6
\q1 For who above can rank with the Eternal,
\q2 what angel can compare with the Eternal?--
\v 7
\q1 a God to be dreaded at the heavenly council,
\q2 an overawing God.
\v 8
\q1 O thou Eternal, God of hosts, who can compare with thee,
\q2 in all thy love and faithfulness?
\p
\v 9
\q1 Thy sway is over the proud sea;
\q2 when the waves toss, thou stillest them.
\v 10
\q1 The Rahab thou didst cut and crush to pieces,
\q2 scattering thy foes by the force of thine arm.
\v 11
\q1 The heavens are thine, the earth is thine,
\q2 ’twas thou didst found the world and all it holds;
\v 12
\q1 the north and south, thou madest them,
\q2 Tabor and Hermon hills acclaim thee.
\v 13
\q1 Thine is a right powerful arm,
\q2 a strong hand, a right hand swung high;
\v 14
\q1 thy throne rests upon equity and justice,
\q2 Love and Faithfulness are thine attendants.
\p
\v 15
\q1 Happy the people who know thy festal songs,
\q2 who live within the sunshine of thy favour!
\v 16
\q1 All day long they exult, O thou Eternal,
\q2 and they extol thine equity.
\v 17
\q1 For thou art our pride, thou our strength,
\q2 and, thanks to thy favour, our honour is high;
\v 18
\q1 we are defended by the Eternal,
\q2 by our King, the Majestic One of Israel.
     * * *
\v 3
\q1 Thou saidst, “I make a compact with my chosen,
\q2 I swear to my servant David,
\v 4
\q1 to make his dynasty endure,
\q2 to make his throne last for all time”;
\v 19
\q1 thou didst tell thy trusted seer,
\q2 thy voice came in a vision:
\q1 “I have crowned a hero,
\q2 chosen a youth from the people,
\v 20
\q1 I have picked out my servant David
\q2 and consecrated him as king.
\v 21
\q1 My hand shall always be a help to him,
\q2 my arm shall make him strong;
\v 18
\q1 no foe shall ever surprise him,
\q2 no miscreant shall master him;
\v 19
\q1 I will shatter his enemies before him,
\q2 and strike down all who hate him;
\v 24
\q1 my loyalty and love shall be with him,
\q2 and I will lift him high in honour;
\v 25
\q1 I will extend his power to the sea,
\q2 and his authority far as the Euphrates;
\v 26
\q1 he shall say, ‘Thou art my Father,
\q2 my God, my saving strength!’
\v 27
\q1 And I will make him my firstborn son,
\q2 highest of all kings on earth.
\v 28
\q1 I will always keep my word to him,
\q2 my compact with him stands secure;
\v 29
\q1 I make his dynasty eternal,
\q2 his throne unending as the heavens.
\v 30
\q1 If his sons forsake my law,
\q2 and follow not my orders,
\v 31
\q1 if they violate my rules,
\q2 and obey not my commands,
\v 32
\q1 then I will scourge them for their sin
\q2 and lash them for their lawlessness,
\v 33
\q1 but I will never take my love from him,
\q2 never will I belie my loyalty;
\v 34
\q1 my compact I will never violate,
\q2 my spoken word I will not change.
\v 35
\q1 Once and for all I took a solemn oath,
\q2 and I will keep my word to David,
\v 36
\q1 that for all time his dynasty should last,
\q2 his throne endure before me like the sun,
\v 37
\q1 fixed as the moon for evermore,
\q2 firm as the constant sky.”
\p
\v 38
\q1 And yet thou hast scorned, discarded,
\q2 stormed against thy chosen!
\v 39
\q1 Thou hast abjured the compact with thy servant,
\q2 and thrown his sacred crown into the dust;
\v 40
\q1 thou hast demolished all his walls
\q2 and laid his forts in ruin;
\v 41
\q1 the passers-by aH plunder him,
\q2 and he is the butt of his neighbours.
\v 42
\q1 Thou hast allowed his enemies to triumph,
\q2 giving delight to all his foes;
\v 43
\q1 thou hast made him retreat before them,
\q2 and hast not upheld him in battle.
\v 44
\q1 Thou hast removed his splendid sceptre
\q2 and dashed his throne to the ground;
\v 45
\q1 thou hast shortened the days of his youth
\q2 and heaped disgrace on him.
\v 46
\q1 How long, O thou Eternal, wilt thou hide away?
\q2 Shall thy wrath, like a fire, burn on for ever?
\v 47
\q1 Remember, Lord, what life is!--
\q2 how frail and futile thou hast made all men!
\v 48
\q1 Who can live on and die not,
\q2 who can escape the grave?
\v 49
\q1 Where is thy former love, O Lord,
\q2 which thou didst pledge to David faithfully?
\v 50
\q1 Remember, Lord, the taunts thrown at thy servants,
\q2 the insults of the world we have to bear,
\v 51
\q1 the taunts of thine own enemies, O Eternal,
\q2 taunting at every step thy chosen ones.
\v 52
\q1 [[Blessed be the Eternal for ever and ever!
\q2 Even so, even so!]]

\s1 A prayer of Moses the man of God
\c 90
\p
\v 1
\q1 Age after age, Lord, thou hast been our home;
\q2 from all eternity thou hast been God,
\v 2
\q1 ere ever hills were born,
\q2 ere ever earth and world were made.
\v 3
\q1 Thou crumbiest man away,
\q2 summoning men back to the dust,
\v 4
\q1 thou to whom a thousand years
\q2 are like the flight of yesterday,
\q2 like an hour passing in the night.
\v 5
\q1 Year after year thou sowest men
\q2 like grass that grows anew,
\v 6
\q1 that in the dawn is fresh and flourishing,
\q2 then by twilight fades and withers.
\v 7
\q1 For under thine anger we perish,
\q2 we sink in terror at thy wrath;
\v 8
\q1 thou dost expose our sins
\q2 and layest our guilty secrets bare before thee;
\v 9
\q1 our days all droop under thy displeasure,
\q2 our life is over like a sigh.
\v 10
\q1 Our life is seventy years at most,\v
\q2 or eighty at the best,
\q1 a span of toil and trouble,
\q2 soon over, and we flit away.
\v 11
\q1 Yet who weighs the full sum of12er thy displeasure?
\q2 Which of us dreads thine ang?
\v 12
\q1 Oh teach us so to count our days,
\q2 that we may take it to heart.
\p
\v 13
\q1 Relent, O thou Eternal, and delay not,
\q2 be sorry for thy servants.
\v 14
\q1 Let thy love dawn on us undimmed,
\q2 that all our life we may be glad and sing;
\v 15
\q1 grant joy as long as thou hast been afflicting us,
\q2 for all the years we have had suffering;
\v 16
\q1 let thy servants see thee at thy saving work,
\q2 and let their children see thy glorious power.
\v 17
\q1 Lord, may thy loving favour rest on us,
\q2 and prosper all the work we undertake.
\v 1
\q1 Happy the man who stays by the Most High in shelter,
\q2 who lives under the shadow of Almighty God,
\v 2
\q1 who calls the Eternal “My refuge and my fortress,
\q2 my God in whom I trust”!
\v 3
\q1 He saves you from the fowler’s snare
\q2 and from the deadly pit;
\v 4
\q1 he protects you with his pinions
\q2 and hides you underneath his wings.
\p
\v 5
\q1 You need not fear the terrors of the night,
\q2 nor arrows flying in the day;
\v 6
\q1 you need not fear plague stalking in the dark,
\q2 nor sudden death at noon;
\v 7
\q1 hundreds may fall beside you,
\q2 thousands at your right hand,
\q2 but the plague will never reach you,
\v 4
\q1 safe shielded by his faithfulness.
\p
\v 8
\q1 You have only to look on and see
\q2 how evil men are punished;
\v 9
\q1 but you have sheltered beside the Eternal,
\q2 and made the Most High God your home,
\v 10
\q1 so no scathe can befall you,
\q2 no plague can approach your tent.
\v 11
\q1 For he puts you under his angels’ charge,
\q1 to guard you wherever you
\v 12
\q1 to lift you in their hands
\q2 lest you trip over a stone;
\v 13
\q1 you can walk over reptiles and cobras,
\q2 trampling on lions and on dragons.
\v 14
\q1 “He clings to me, so I deliver him;
\q2 I set him safe, because he cares for me;
\v 15
\q1 I will answer his cry and be with him in trouble,
\q1 delivering him and honouring him;
\v 16
\q1 I will satisfy him with long life,
\q1 and let him see my saving care.”
\s1 A song for the sabbath. To be accompanied.
\c 92
\p
\v 1
\q1 It is a joy to give thanks to nn the Eternal,
\q2 to sing thy praise, O thou Most High,
\v 2
\q1 to proclaim thy goodness in the morning
\q2 and thy faithfulness at night,
\v 3
\q1 to the sound of a ten-stringed lute,
\q2 to the sweet music of the lyre;
\v 4
\q1 thy doings have made me glad, O thou Eternal,
\q2 I sing for joy at all that thou hast done.
\v 5
\q1 How great thy deeds are, O Eternal,
\q2 how deep are thy designs!
\v 6
\q1 The dull man does not see,
\q2 the senseless does not understand,
\v 7
\q1 that when bad men thrive like grass,
\q2 and evildoers flourish,
\q1 ’tis only to be rooted up for ever,
\v 8
\q1 while thou art supreme ever, O Eternal.
\p
\v 9
\q1 Yonder are thy foes, O thou Eternal,
\q2 yonder are thy foes, destroyed!--
\q2 all evildoers scattered!
\v 10
\q1 But thou dost raise me high to honour,
\q2 thou dost revive my failing strength;
\v 11
\q1 I feast mine eyes on my defeated foes,
\q2 I hear with joy my enemies’ doom.
\v 12
\q1 But good men flourish like a palm,
\q2 and grow like cedars on Lebanon;
\v 13
\q1 planted inside the Eternal’s precincts,
\q2 they flourish in the courts of our God,
\v 14
\q1 still bearing fruit when they are old,
\q2 still fresh and green--
\v 15
\q1 showing how just the Eternal is,
\q2 my Strength who never errs.
\c
\p
\v 1
\q1 The Eternal is reigning, robed in majesty;
\q2 the Eternal is robed with a girdle of power.
\q1 Thou hast steadied and settled the world,
\v 2
\q2 thy throne stands firm from of old,
\q2 thou art from all eternity.
\v 3
\q1 The floods may storm, O thou Eternal,
\q2 the floods may storm aloud,
\q2 the floods may storm and thunder;
\v 4
\q1 but high above the roaring billows,
\q2 high above the ocean breakers,
\q2 the Eternal stands supreme.
\v 5
\q1 Thine own authority will never fail,
\q2 thy house will never lose its sanctity,
\q2 O thou Eternal One.
\c 94

\v 1
\q1 O thou Eternal, thou avenging God,
\q2 O thou avenging God, appear;
\v 2
\q1 rise up, O Ruler of the world,
\q2 and let the haughty have what they deserve!
\v 3
\q1 How long is it to last, O thou Eternal,
\q2 this exultation of ungodly men,
\v 4
\q1 blustering insolently, the evildoers--
\q2 lording it arrogantly?
\v 5
\q1 They crush thy people, O Eternal,
\q2 thy heritage they are harrying,
\v 6
\q1 killing the widow and the foreigner
\q2 and murdering the fatherless;
\v 7
\q1 and they think the Eternal never sees them--
\q2 Jacob’s God will never heed them!
\p
\v 8
\q1 But mark this, dullest of the dull--
\q2 when will you understand, O senseless men?--
\v 9
\q1 is he deaf, he who made the ear?
\q2 Is he blind, he who formed the eye?
\v 10
\q1 Can he not punish men, he who is training them?
\q2 Has he no knowledge, he who teaches men?
\v 11
\q1 Knowledge! The Eternal knows that human plans
\q2 are but an empty breath!
\p
\v 12
\q1 Happy is he who has thy discipline
\q2 and thine instruction, training him
\v 13
\q1 calmly to wait on, in adversity,
\q2 till a pit is dug for the ungodly!
\v 14
\q1 For the Eternal will not leave his people,
\q2 never will he forsake his own;
\v 15
\q1 no, goodness shall have justice done to it--
\q2 the future is with men of upright mind.
\p
\v 16
\q1 Who is my champion against the ungodly?
\q2 Who sides with me against the evildoers?
\v 17
\q1 If the Eternal had not been my help,
\q2 I would have soon passed to the silent land.
\v 18
\q1 When I think my foot is slipping.
\q2 thy goodness, O Eternal, holds me up;
\v 19
\q1 when doubts crowd into my mind,
\q2 thy comforts cheer me.
\p
\v 20
\q1 Can evil rulers have thee for an ally,
\q2 who work us injury by law,
\v 21
\q1 who make an onset upon honest men,
\q2 and doom the innocent to death?
\v 22
\q1 No, the Eternal who is my protection,
\q2 my God who is my strength, my safety--
\v 23
\q1 may he requite them for their crime,
\q2 and for their evil make an end of them!
\c 95
\p
\v 1
\q1 Oh come let us sing to the O Eternal,
\q2 let us sing loudly to our saving Strength,
\v 2
\q1 let us come before him with thanksgiving,
\q2 shouting to him songs of praise!
\v 3
\q1 For a great God is the Eternal,
\q2 the great King of all the gods;
\v 4
\q1 the depths of earth he in his hand,
\q2 the mountain-peaks are his,
\v 5
\q1 he made the sea, he made the land,
\q2 and sea and land are his.
\v 6
\q1 Come, let us worship and bow down,
\q2 kneeling to him who made us;
\v 7
\q1 the Eternal is our God, and we
\q2 the people whom he shepherds.
     * * *
\q1 ... if you would only listen to my voice to-day,
\v 8
\q1 and be not stubborn as at Meribah,
\q2 as once at Massa in the wilderness,
\v 9
\q1 when your forefathers doubted me,
\q2 and tested me, though they had felt my power.
\v 10
\q1 For forty years I loathed that generation;
\q2 I said, “They are a senseless people,
\q2 who care not for my ways”;
\v 11
\q1 so I swore in solemn anger,
\q2 they should never reach my rest.

\q1 let the heathen hear his glory,
\q2 let every nation know his wondrous deeds.
\v 4
\q1 For great is the Eternal, loudly to be praised,
\q2 and to be feared above all gods;

\q1 for all gods of the nations are mere idols,

\q1 grandeur and majesty attend him,

\v 13
\q1 thou wilt rise to have pity on Sion--
\q2 ’tis time, ’tis time to favour her;
\v 14
\q1 her scattered stones are dear to thy servants,
\q2 and they are distressed at the dust of her ruins.
\p
\v 16
\q1 When the Eternal builds up Sion,
\q2 appearing in his majesty,
\v 17
\q1 when he turns to the forlorn,
\q2 despising not their prayer,
\v 15
\q1 then pagans will revere thee,
\q2 all kings on earth will own thy majesty.
\p
\v 19
\q1 When the Eternal bends from his sacred height,
\q2 and looks from heaven to earth,
\v 20
\q1 to hear the prisoner’s groan,
\q2 and to release the doomed;
\v 18
\q1 let this be set down for future generations,
\q2 that people yet unborn may praise the Eternal,
\v 21
\q1 rehearsing his fame in Sion
\q2 and praising him at Jerusalem,
\v 22
\q1 when realms and nations gather there
\q2 to worship the Eternal.
\p
\v 25
\q1 Thou didst found the earth of old,
\q2 the heavens are the work of thy hands;
\v 26
\q1 they vanish, but thou shalt endure,
\q2 they wear out like a robe;
\q1 thou changest them like garments, and they change,
\v 27
\q1 but thou art still the same, O thou Eternal,
\q2 thy years shall never end;
\v 28
\q1 and in thy presence live thy servants’ children,
\q2 and their posterity perpetually.
\s1 A song of David.

\p
\v 1
\q1 Bless the Eternal, O my soul,
\q2 let all my being bless his sacred name;
\v 2
\q1 bless the Eternal, O my soul,
\q2 remember all his benefits;
\v 3
\q1 he pardons all your sins,
\q2 and all your sicknesses he heals,
\v 4
\q1 he saves your life from death,
\q2 he crowns you with his love and pity,
\v 5
\q1 he gives you all your heart’s desire,
\q2 renewing your youth like an eagle’s.
\v 6
\q1 The Eternal vindicates the cause
\q2 of any who are wronged;
\v 7
\q1 he let Moses see this purpose,
\q2 and Israel his methods.
\v 8
\q1 The Eternal is pitiful and gracious,
\q2 slow to be angry, rich in love;
\v 9
\q1 he will not always chafe,
\q2 he will not hold to his anger for all time;
\v 10
\q1 he treats us not according to our sins,
\q2 he deals not with us as our guilt deserves;
\v 11
\q1 but, high as heaven is over earth,
\q2 so vast his love is to his worshippers;
\v 12
\q1 as far as east from the west,
\q2 so far he puts our sins away from us.
\v 13
\q1 As a father pities his children,
\q2 so the Eternal pities his worshippers;
\v 14
\q1 he knows what we are made of,
\q2 he remembers we are dust.
\v 15
\q1 Poor man!--his days are like the grass,
\q2 he blooms like a flower in the meadow;
\v 16
\q1 at the breath of a breeze it is gone,
\q2 and its place never sees it again.
\v 17
\q1 But the Eternal’s love is everlasting,
\q2 his loyalty goes on to children’s children,
\v 18
\q1 when they obey his compact
\q2 and remember to do his bidding.
\p
\v 19
\q1 In heaven has the Eternal fixed his throne,
\q2 and his dominion covers all the world.
\v 20
\q1 Bless the Eternal, O his angels,
\q2 ye strong spirits who obey his word!
\v 21
\q1 Bless the Eternal, all his hosts,
\q2 ye servants who carry out his will!
\v 22
\q1 Bless the Eternal, all his works
\q2 in every sphere of his dominion!
\c 104
\p
\v 1
\q1 Bless the Eternal, O my soul!
\q2 Eternal One, my God, thou art most great,
\q2 arrayed in glorious majesty.
\v 2
\q1 Thou wrappest thyself in a robe of light,
\q2 thou spreadest the sky like a tent,
\v 3
\q2 thou buildest thy chambers on the waters above;
\q1 thou makest clouds thy chariot,
\q2 thou ridest on the wings of the wind;
\v 4
\q1 thou makest winds thy messengers,
\q2 fire and flame thy servants.
\p
\v 5
\q1 Thou didst found the earth upon its pillars,
\q2 never to be shaken,
\v 6
\q1 drawing the deep over it,
\q2 till the waters rose over the mountains;
\v 7
\q1 but they retired at thy rebuke,
\q2 scared at the sound of thy thunder,
\v 9
\q1 never to pass thine appointed bounds,
\q2 or cover earth again;
\v 8
\q1 the mountains rose, the valleys sank,
\q2 to the place thou madest for them.
\p
\v 10
\q1 He pours the streams into the valleys,
\q2 that flow between the mountains,
\v 11
\q1 where all the wild beasts drink,
\q2 wild asses quench their thirst;
\v 12
\q1 there the wild birds settle,
\q2 singing among the branches,
\v 16
\q1 as the great trees drink their fill,
\q2 the cedars the Eternal sowed on Lebanon,
\v 17
\q1 where birds build their nests,
\q2 the stork with her home in the cypress.
\p
\v 18
\q1 The high hills shelter the wild goat,
\q2 the marmot hides in the rocks.
\v 10
\q1 He waters the hills from his high chambers,
\q2 and rains abundantly upon the land,
\v 14
\q1 till grass grows for the cattle,
\q2 and fodder for the beasts that serve mankind;
\v that
\q1 he may bring food from the earth,
\v 15
\q1 wine to cheer up the heart of man,
\q1 oil, that his skin may shine,
\q2 bread to sustain his strength.
\p
\v 19
\q1 He marks the seasons by the moon,
\q2 he tells the sun when it must set.
\v 20
\q1 Thou makest it dark; night falls,
\q2 and every wild beast in the wood is moving--
\v 21
\q1 lions roaring for their prey
\q2 and claiming food from God;
\v 22
\q1 when the sun rises, then they slink away
\q2 to lie down in their lairs,
\v 23
\q1 but man comes out to work,
\q2 and labours till the evening.
\p
\v 24
\q1 How manifold thy works, Eternal One,
\q2 all of them wisely made!
\v 25
\q1 Yonder the sea lies, vast and broad,
\q2 with its countless swarms,
\q2 with creatures small and great,
\v 26
\q1 with fleets of the nautilus,
\q2 with leviathan at his play!
\v 24
\q1 The world is full of thy creatures,
\v 27
all looking to thee
\q2 for their food in season due;
\v 28
\q1 what thou givest, that they gather,
\q2 feasting from thine open hand.
\v 29
\q1 But when thy face is hidden, they are scared,
\q2 when thou recallest their breath, they die.
\v 30
\q1 Yet a breath from thee brings them into being,
\q2 renewing the face of the earth.
\v 31
\q1 For ever may the glorious might of the Eternal last!
\q2 May the Eternal joy in his own works!
\v 32
\q1 Earth trembles at a glance from him,
\q2 the mountains smoke at his touch.
\p
\v 33
\q1 Long as I live, I will sing to the Eternal,
\q2 and praise my God while I have breath.
\v 34
\q1 May these my thoughts please him--
\q2 I find my joy in the Eternal!
\v 35
\q1 May sinners be swept out of the world,
\q2 may evil men no longer live in it!
\q1 Bless the Eternal, O my soul! Hallelujah!
\c
\p
\v 1
\q1 Give thanks to the Eternal, proclaim his fame,
\q2 celebrate among the nations his exploits,
\v 2
\q1 sing to him, make music to him,
\q2 go over all the wonders he has done,
\v 3
\q1 glory in his sacred name,
\q2 let the Eternal’s worshippers rejoice in heart.
\v 4
\q1 Worship the Eternal and be strengthened,
\q2 worship in his presence evermore;
\v 5
\q1 never forget the wonders he has done,
\q2 his marvels and his sentences of doom,
\v 6
\q1 O race of Abraham his servant,
\q2 O sons of Jacob whom he chose.
\p
\v 7
\q1 The Eternal, he is our God,
\q2 supreme over all nations.
\v 8
\q1 He never forgets his compact,
\q2 the pledge given for a thousand generations,
\v 9
\q1 the compact made with Abraham,
\q2 the oath he swore to Isaac,
\v 10
\q1 q1 confirming it as a decree to Jacob,
\q2 for Israel as a lasting compact,
\v 11
\q1 that he would give them Canaan’s land,
\q2 to hold it as their own possession.
\p
\v 12
\q1 Few in number were our fathers,
\q2 few and foreigners,
\v 13
\q1 wandering from one nation to another,
\q2 and from realm to realm;
\v 14
\q1 but he would not let a man oppress them,
\q2 he would punish kings on their account,
\v 15
\q1 saying, “Never touch my chosen,
\q2 never harm my prophets.”
\v 16
\q1 He called a famine on the land,
\q2 destroying all the Egyptians’ sustenance.
\v 17
\q1 He sent a man in front of them,
\q2 Joseph, sold as a slave;
\v 18
\q1 his feet were forced into fetters,
\q2 he was laid in irons,
\v 19
\q1 till the promise of the Eternal came true,
\q2 the promise that tested him.
\v 20
\q1 Then the king sent and released him,
\q2 the monarch set him free,
\v 21
\q1 and made him master of his palace,
\q2 lord of all that he possessed,
\v 22
\q1 to control his nobles as he pleased,
\q2 and dictate to his councillors.
\p
\v 23
\q1 Then Israel entered Egypt,
\q2 Jacob lived in the land of Khem.
\v 24
\q1 God multiplied his people greatly,
\q2 till they outnumbered the Egyptians,
\v 25
\q1 who turned to hate his people,
\q2 to handle his servants craftily.
\v 26
\q1 So he sent his servant Moses,
\q2 and Aaron whom he chose;
\v 27
\q1 he wrought portents within Egypt,,
\q2 marvels in the land of Khem;
\v 28
\q1 darkness he sent, he made it dark,
\q2 but they would not heed his word;
\v 29
\q1 he turned their waters into blood,
\q2 and killed their fish;
\v 30
\q1 frogs swarmed over their country,
\q2 into the very chambers of the king;
\v 31
\q1 dog-flies swarmed at his command,
\q2 and lice through all their land;
\v 32
\q1 he gave them hail for rain,
\q2 as fire flashed over the land,
\v 33
\q1 striking their vines and fig-trees,
\q2 breaking the trees of the country;
\v 34
\q1 at his bidding locusts came,
\q2 and grasshoppers past counting,
\v 35
\q1 that ate up all the green growth of the land,
\q2 and every crop;
\v 36
\q1 he struck down all the firstborn in their land,
\q2 each oldest male child.
\p
\v 37
\q1 Then he led out his clansmen,
\q2 carrying spoil of gold and silver,
\q2 not a weary man among them;
\v 38
\q1 glad was Egypt when they left,
\q2 for they were dreaded.
\v 39
\q1 He spread out clouds to shelter them,
\q2 and lit them in the night with fire;
\v 40
\q1 he sent them quails, at their demand,
\q2 and bread of heaven in plenty;
\v 41
\q1 he opened rocks, and through the sand
\q2 water rushed like a river.
\v 42
\q1 Eor he remembered his own sacred pledge
\q2 to Abraham his servant.
\v 43
\q1 So he brought his people out with joy,
\q2 his chosen with a song and shout;
\v 44
\q1 he gave them the lands of the nations,
\q2 and they possessed the fruit of others’ toils.
\v 45
\q1 ’Twas all that they should carry out his orders
\q2 and obey his laws.
\c 106
\p
\v 1
\q1 Hallelujah! Give thanks to the Eternal!--he is good,
\q2 his kindness never fails.
\v 2
\q1 Who can proclaim the Eternal’s mighty deeds,
\q2 or do full justice to his praise?
\p
\v 3
\q1 Happy are they who hold to what is right,
\q2 who do their duty at all times!
\v 5
\q1 They share the welfare of thy chosen band,
\q2 thy nation’s joy, the triumph of thy land.
\p
\v 4
\q1 Remember us in thy goodwill, Eternal,
\q2 oh save and prosper thine own people.
\v 6
\q1 For, like our fathers, we have sinned,
\q2 we have done evil, have done wickedly.
\p
\v 7
\q1 At the Reed Sea our fathers defied the Most High,
\q2 heedless of his wonders done in Egypt,
\q2 forgetting all the kindness he had shown them.
\v 8
\q1 Yet he saved them for his own sake,
\q2 to display his power;
\v 9
\q1 the Reed Sea dried up at his bidding,
\q2 through the deep he led them like a desert,
\v 10
\q1 saving them from hostile hands,
\q2 rescuing them from the foe;
\v 11
\q1 the waters rose over their enemies,
\q2 till not a man was left.
\v 12
\q1 Then they believed his promise,
\q2 and they sang his praise.
\p
\v 13
\q1 But soon they forgot what he had done,
\q2 they would not be patient with his purposes;
\v 14
\q1 they had a craving in the wilderness,
\q2 that made them doubt God in the desert;
\v 15
\q1 he let them have what they desired,
\q2 then—made them loathe it!
\v 16
\q1 When they were jealous of Moses in the camp,
\q2 and of Aaron, whom the Eternal consecrated,
\v 18
\q1 fire broke out in their company,
\q2 and flames burned up the wicked;
\v 15
\q1 earth opened to swallow Dathan up,
\q2 and closed over Abiram’s crew.
\p
\v 18
\q1 At Horeb they made a calf,
\q2 and worshipped a metal image,
\v 20
\q1 bartering God their glory
     for the image of an ox that munches grass!
\v 21
\q1 They forgot God their deliverer,
\q2 who had done great deeds in Egypt,
\v 22
\q1 marvels in the land of Khem,
\q2 deeds of awe at the Reed Sea.
\v 23
\q1 So he threatened to destroy them,
\q2 had not Moses stepped into the breach,
\q1 had not Moses, whom he had chosen, faced him,
\q2 to avert his deadly wrath.
\p
\v 24
\q1 And then they scorned the land of delight;
\q2 they would not believe what he promised,
\v 25
\q1 but grumbled in their tents
\q2 and would not listen to his word;
\v 26
\q1 so he swore solemnly
\q2 to lay them low in the desert,
\v 27
\q1 to scatter their children among heathen men,
\q2 and disperse them over the world.
\p
\v 28
\q1 When they joined the Baal of Peor,
\q2 and ate food offered to the dead,
\v 29
\q1 they angered him with their misdeeds,
\q2 and plague broke out among them.
\v 30
\q1 But Phinehas rose to interpose,
\q2 and so the plague Was checked--
\v 31
\q1 which was counted in his favour,
\q2 as a merit for all time.
\v 32
\q1 At the waters of Meribah they enraged God,
\v 33
\q2 rebelling against his Spirit,
\v 32
\q1 till they made Moses go wrong
\v 33
\q1 and utter words in haste.
\p
\v 34
\q1 Nor did they root out the pagans,
\q2 as the Eternal ordered;
\v 35
\q1 they mixed with heathen men
\q2 and learned their ways,
\v 36
\q1 and worshipping their idols were ensnared;
\v 37
\q1 they sacrificed to demons,
\q2 sacrificed their sons and daughters,
\v 38
\q1 pouring out innocent blood,
\q2 till the land was stained with murder.
\v 39
\q1 They were befouled by what they did,
\q2 and broke faith by their practices.
\v 40
\q1 So the Eternal’s anger blazed against his people,
\q2 he loathed his heritage;
\v 41
\q1 he abandoned them to pagans,
\q2 to be ruled by those who hated them;
\v 42
\q1 their foes oppressed them,
\q2 forced them to submission.
\v 43
\q1 Many a time he rescued them;
\q2 but they would take their own rebellious way,
\q2 till evildoing wasted them away.
\v 44
\q1 Yet he regarded their distress,
\q2 when he heard them wailing;
\v 45
\q1 he remembered for their sake his compact,
\q2 in his great goodness he relented;
\v 46
\q1 he made their very captors
\q2 have compassion upon them.
\p
\v 47
\q1 O thou Eternal, our God, save us,
\q2 gather us out of the nations,
\q1 that we may give thanks to thy sacred name,
\q2 and triumph in thy deeds of praise.
\p
\v 46
\q1 Blessed be the Eternal, Israel’s God, from age to age, for ever!
\q2 Let all the people add “Amen.”

\v 1
\q1 Hallelujah! “Give thanks to the Eternal!--he is good,
\q2 his kindness never fails!”
\v 2
\q1 Be this the song of the redeemed,
\q2 redeemed by the Eternal from their foes,
\v 3
\q1 gathered from lands afar,
\q2 from east and west, from north and south.
\p
\v 4
\q1 Some wandered in the lonely wilderness,
\q2 they could not find a settled town;
\v 5
\q1 q1 their soul was faint
\q2 with hunger and with thirst.
\v 6
\q1 They cried to the Eternal in their need,
\q2 to save them from their evil plight,
\v 7
\q1 and straight he led them
\q2 to a settled town.
\v 8
\q1 Let them thank the Eternal for his kindness,
\q2 and for the wonders that he does for men;
\v 9
\q1 he satisfies their longing thirst,
\q2 and fills them in their hunger.
\v 10
\q1 Some lay in darkness and in gloom,
\q2 prisoners in chains and misery,
\v 11
\q1 because they had rebelled at God’s commands
\q2 and scorned what the Most High enjoined;
\v 12
\q1 hard labour crushed their spirit,
\q2 and wearied out, forlorn,
\v 13
\q1 they cried to the Eternal in their need,
\q2 to save them from their evil plight;
\v 14
\q1 he took them from the darkness and the gloom,
\q2 he snapped their chains.
\v 15
\q1 Let them thank the Eternal for his kindness,
\q2 and for the wonders that he does for men;
\v 16
\q1 he breaks the gates of bronze,
\q2 and shatters iron bars.
\p
\v 17
\q1 Some, weakened by their sinful ways,
\q2 were sick and suffering through evildoing;
\v 18
\q1 they had a loathing for all food,
\q2 were on the verge of death;
\v 19
\q1 they cried to the Eternal in their need,
\q2 to save them from their evil plight;
\v 20
\q1 he sent his word to heal them and preserve their life.
\v 21
\q1 Let them thank the Eternal for his kindness,
\q2 and for the wonders that he does for men;
\v 22
\q1 let them offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
\q2 and joyfully recount what he has done.
\p
\v 23
\q1 Some crossed the sea in ships,
\q2 trading in great waters;
\v 24
\q1 they saw what the Eternal does,
\q2 his marvels in the deep.
\v 25
\q1 When the gale rose at his bidding,
\q2 and the waves tossed with the storm,
\v 26
\q1 they soared to heaven, sank to the depth,
\q2 their courage melting;
\v 27
\q1 they reeled and staggered like a drunken man,
\q2 and were at their wit’s end.
\v 28
\q1 They cried to the Eternal in their need,
\q2 to save them from their evil plight;
\v 29
\q1 he stilled the storm to a whisper,
\q2 till the waves were hushed--
\v 30
\q1 glad were they for the calm--
\q2 and then he brought them to their longed-for haven.
\v 31
\q1 Let them thank the Eternal for his kindness,
\q2 and for the wonders that he does for men;
\v 32
\q1 let them extol him, when the people meet,
\q2 and praise him in the council of the sheikhs.
\p
\v 33
\q1 He turns streams into a desert,
\q2 and fountains into dry land;
\v 34
\q1 he turns an oasis into a salt waste,
\q2 to punish people for their sins.
\v 35
\q1 He turns a desert into pools of water,
\q2 and dry land into fountains,
\v 36
\q1 where he settles famished folk,
\q2 to build a town for habitation,
\v 37
\q1 sowing fields and planting vineyards,
\q2 gathering in their harvest;
\v 38
\q1 by his blessing they increase,
\q2 and their herds never diminish.
\p
\v 40
\q1 He pours contempt on lords,
\q2 and sets them in a pathless waste astray,
\v 39
\q1 till they grow few and faint
\q2 under the weight of misery;
\v 41
\q1 but he lifts poor men from their woes,
\q2 and makes their household like a fruitful flock.
\v 42
\q1 Good men rejoice to see this,
\q2 wrongdoers are silenced.
\v 43
\q1 Let any wise man ponder it,
\q2 and lay to heart how kind the Eternal is.

\q1 God gave his sacred promise:

\q1 Gilead is mine, Manasseh mine,
\q2 Ephraim I take for helmet,
\q2 Judah for my baton--

\q1 Moab I make a wash-basin,
\q2 Edom I claim as subject,
\q2 and over Philistia I will triumph.”
\v 10
\q1 Ah, who will lead us inside the hill-fort?
\q2 Who will take us conquering into Edom?
\v 11
\q1 Hast thou not discarded us, shamed us, O God?
\q2 thou would’st not march out with our army.
\v 12
\q1 Help us against the foe,

\v 9
\q1 May his children become fatherless,
\q2 his wife a widow!
\v 10
\q1 May they be vagabonds and beggars,
\q2 driven out of their ruined home!
\v 11
\q1 May creditors seize all he has,
\q2 and strangers help themselves to all he made!
\v 12
\q1 May not a soul be kind to him,
\q2 may no one pity his fatherless children!
\v 13
\q1 May his posterity be rooted out,
\q2 and his name blotted out in a single generation!
\v 14
\q1 But never may his father’s evil be forgotten,
\q2 or his mother’s sin be blotted out!
\v 15
\q1 (The Eternal ever keep them in his mind,
\q2 to root them from the earth!)
\v 16
\q1 Never did he remember to be kind;
\q2 but wretched, weak, and broken-hearted creatures
\q2 he persecuted to the death.
\v 17
\q1 He would not bless?--blessings be far from him!
\q2 He loved to curse?--may curses light on him!
\v 18
\q1 May curses cling to him Eke clothes!
\q2 Curses soak into him Eke water,
\q2 sink to his very bones Eke oil!
\v 19
\q1 May curses be the garment he puts on!
\q2 Curses be like his girdle day by day!
\p
\v 20
\q1 So may the Eternal reward my accusers,
\q2 and all who threaten my life!
\v 21
\q1 O Lord the Eternal, act on my behalf,
\q2 Oh rescue me in thy kind love;
\v 22
\q1 for I am weak and wretched,
\q2 my heart is in anguish,
\v 23
\q1 my days are brief as any evening shadow,
\q2 I am whirled off like a locust,
\v 24
\q1 my knees are giving way with fasting,
\q2 my flesh is thin and shriveled;
\v 25
\q1 they are taunting, taunting me,
\q2 tossing their heads at the sight of me!
\v 26
\q1 Eternal One, my God, oh help me,
\q2 save me in thy love--
\v 27
\q1 to let them know thy power by this,
\q2 what thou canst do, Eternal One!
\v 28
\q1 They may curse, but do thou bless;
\q2 confounded be my foes, but let thy servant joy.
\v 29
\q1 May my opponents be covered with disgrace,
\q2 robed in their own dishonour!
\v 30
\q1 I will give thanks aloud to the Eternal;
\q2 yes, I will praise him in the congregation,
\v 31
\q1 for he supports a helpless man,
\q2 to save him from his persecutors.

\q1 This oracle has the Eternal for my lord:
\q2 “Sit throned at my right hand, until I make your foes your footstool.”
\v 2
\q1 Yes, the Eternal shall send you from Sion
\q2 the sceptre of your sway,
\q1 that you may reign amid your foes,
\q2 arrayed in sacred vestments.
\v 3
\q1 The day you come to power, you are supreme,
\q2 vital and fresh like dew-drops of the dawn;
\v 4
\q1 “You are to be a priest for life”--
\q2 so swears the Eternal, his oath will not change--
\q2 “a priest as once Melkizedek was.”
\v 5
\q1 The Lord is at your side,
\q2 shattering kings upon his day of wrath.
\p
\v 6
\q1 My lord sends pagans to their doom,
\q2 filling the valleys with their corpses,
\q2 shattering their chiefs far and wide;
\v 7
\q1 he drinks from any stream he has to cross,
\q2 then charges forward triumphing.
\c 111
\p
\v 1
\q1 Hallelujah. With all my heart I thank the Eternal,
\q2 in gatherings of good men for fellowship.
\v 2
\q1 Great are the Eternal’s doings,
\q2 to be studied by all who delight in them;
\v 3
\q1 splendid and glorious are his deeds,
\q2 his victories know no end;
\v 4
\q1 he will have us celebrate his wondrous deeds,
\q2 for the Eternal is gracious and pitiful.
\v 5
\q1 He feeds his worshippers;
\q2 never does he forget his compact.
\v 6
\q1 He has shown his people his power in action,
\q2 as he gave them the homes of the heathen.
\v 7
\q1 Faithfully he deals and justly,
\q2 trustworthy are all his precepts;
\v 8
\q1 his orders are enacted for all time,
\q2 issued in faithfulness and justice;
\v 9
\q1 he has sent his people freedom,
\q2 fixing his compact with them for all time--
\q2 a God majestic, terrible.
\v 10
\q1 The first thing in knowledge is reverence for the Eternal:
\q2 it is sound sense for everyone.
\q2 His praise endures for ever.
\c 112
\p
\v 1
\q1 Happy the man who reverences the Eternal,
\q2 who finds rich joy in his commands!
\v 2
\q1 His children rise to power within the land;
\q2 the race of the upright are blessed.
\v 3
\q1 Riches and wealth are in Ms house,
\q2 good fortune never fails him.
\v 4
\q1 Light dawns on the good man,
\q2 the upright man so mild and merciful.
\v 5
\q1 All goes well with the generous, open-handed,
\q2 who will act fairly;
\v 6
\q1 never shall that man come to grief;
\q2 the good man’s memory never fades.
\v 7
\q1 He has no fear of evil tidings,
\q2 he trusts the Eternal with a steady heart;
\v 8
\q1 his heart is firm and fearless,
\q2 certain that he will see his foes collapse.
\v 9
\q1 He gives to the poor lavishly,
\q2 and so good fortune never fails him--
\q2 he rises to high power and honour.
\v 10
\q1 Ungodly men look on and grieve,
\q2 they gnash their teeth and--disappear;
\q2 the ungodly’s hope will come to nothing.
\c 113
\p
\v 1
\q1 Hallelujah. Praise the Eternal, servants of the Eternal, praise his name!
\v 2
\q1 Blessed be the Eternal’s name from now and evermore!
\v 3
\q1 Praise to the Eternal’s name from sunrise to sunset!
\p
\v 4
\q1 The Eternal is supreme over the nations, majestic over the heavens;
\v 5
\q1 who is like the Eternal, our God, dwelling in high heaven,
\v 6
\q1 stooping to cast his eyes on earth below?
\p
\v 7
\q1 He raises poor men from the dust, the wretched from the dunghill,
\v 8
\q1 to seat them beside princes, the princes of his people;
\v 9
\q1 he makes the barren wife a happy mother in her home.
\c 114
\p
\v 1
\q1 Hallelujah. When Israel went from Egypt,
\q2 and Jacob’s household from a foreign folk,
\v 2
\q1 Judah he took to be his own,
\q2 and Israel for his domain.
\v 3
\q1 The sea fled at the sight of it,
\q2 Jordan made way for them;
\v 4
\q1 the mountains leaped like rams,
\q2 the hills like lambs.
\p
\v 5
\q1 What ails you, sea, that thus you flee?
\q2 Jordan, that you make way?
\v 6
\q1 you mountains, to leap thus like rams?
\q2 you hills like lambs?
\p
\v 7
\q1 Ay, tremble, earth, at the Eternal’s presence,
\q2 before Jacob’s God,
\v 8
\q1 who turns a rock into a pool,
\q2 flint into fountains!
\c 115

\q1 Not for us, O thou i f r i Eternal, not for us, J-1D but for thyself, win praise, to prove that thou thyself art kind and true.
     Why should pagans sneer, 2 “Where is that God of theirs?”
     Ah, he is in heaven, our God, 3 he does whate’er he pleases.
     Their idols are mere gold and 4 silver,
     made by the hands of men,
     with mouths—but they never 5 speak,
     with eyes—but they cannot see,
     with ears—but they cannot hear, 6 with noses—but they cannot smell,
     with hands—but they cannot 7 feel,
     with feet—but they cannot walk!
     No sound from them!
     No breath of life is in them!
     So be it -with their makers, 8 with all who trust in them!
         8 	But Israel trusts in the Eternal; he is their shield and succour.
         9 	Aaron’s household trusts in the
     Eternal;
     he is their shield and succour.
         10 	The Eternal’s worshippers
     trust in the Eternal; he is their shield and succour.
         11 	The Eternal remembers us, and
     he will bless us, he will bless Israel and Aaron’s household,
         12 	he will bless his worshippers,
     both high and low alike.
         13 	The Eternal will make you in­
     crease,
     will multiply you and your children.
         14 	Your blessing comes from the
     Eternal,
     who made heaven and earth,
         15 	the heaven that the Eternal
     holds himself,
     the earth he has assigned to men.
         16 	The dead cannot praise the
     Eternal,
     nor any who sink to the silent land;
         17 	but we Bless the Eternal now
     and evermore.
         1 	1 1 Z" Hallelujah.
     HO I love to know that the
     Eternal listens to the voice of my appeal;
         2 	because he bends his ear to me,
     I will pray to him all my life. 61 62 63 64
     Return to thy rest, O my soul, 7 for the Eternal has dealt lov­ingly with thee.
     Thou hast saved my life from 8 death,
     mine eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling;
     I will live mindful of thee now 9 in the land of the living.
     Though I cried out, “I am 10 crushed,”
     thinking, in my distraction, 11 “All men are a failure,” yet I had faith.
     Now, what can I render to the 12 Eternal
     for all his benefits to me?
     I will offer a libation for my 13 rescue,
     and proclaim the Eternal aloud;
     I will pay what I vowed to the 14 Eternal,
     in presence of all his people.
     Precious in the eyes of the 15 Eternal
     is the death of his devoted.
     Eternal One, I am indeed thy 16 servant,
     thy servant, thy retainer; thou hast delivered me.
     I will offer thee the sacrifice of 17 thanksgiving,
     and proclaim the Eternal aloud;
     I will pay what I vowed to the 18 Eternal,
     in presence of all his people,
     in the courts of the Eternal’s 19
     house,
     within thee, O Jerusalem.
     Hallelujah. -| -| /■* 1

     A AO Give thanks to the Eter­nal!—he is good, his kindness never fails.
         2 	Let Israel repeat,
     “His kindness never fails”;
         3 	let Aaron’s household repeat,
     “His kindness never fails”;
         4 	let the Eternal’s worshippers re­
     peat,
     “His kindness never fails.”
         5 	I was hard pressed, I called to
     the Eternal;
     the Eternal answered, and he set me free.
         6 	The Eternal is upon my side; I
     have no fear.
     What can man do to me?
         7 	I have the Eternal as my
     Helper;
     so I shall feast mine eyes on my defeated foes.
         8 	Far better to rely on the Eternal
     than put faith in men;
         9 	far better to rely on the Eter­
     nal than put faith in princes.
         10 	The pagans were all swarming
     round me;
     I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
         11 	Swarming round me, they beset
     me;
     I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
     13 They swarmed like bees about me;
     I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
     They blazed like the fire among thorns;
     I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
         13 	Hard pressed was I, about to
     fall,
     but the Eternal helped me.
         14 	The Eternal is my strength, of
     him I sing,
     he has delivered me indeed.
         15 	Hark,the joyful shout of triumph
     in the tents of the just!—
     “The Eternal’s right hand car­ries the day,”
     “The Eternal’s right hand tri- 16 umphs,”
     “The Eternal’s right hand car­ries the day!”
     I shall not die, but live	17
     to proclaim the Eternal’s deeds;
     The Eternal has been chastening 18 me sorely,
     but he has not left me to die.
     Open to me the gates of Vic- 19 tory,
     that I may enter in to thank the Eternal.
     “Here is the Eternal’s gate; 20
     the just alone can enter.”
     Thanks unto thee for answering 21 me,
     for thy deliverance.
     The stone the builders cast 22 aside
     is now the building’s strength and pride;
     this is the doing of the Eternal— 23
     we can but watch and won­der.
     “This is a day we owe to the 24 Eternal;
     let us be glad and rejoice in it.
     O thou Eternal, lend thine aid! 25
     O thou Eternal, prosper us!
     In the Eternal’s name, blessed 26 be he who enters!”
     “We bless you from the house of the Eternal,

     Round and round the altar
     dance,

     singing, “Thou art my God, I 28 praise thee,
     thou art my God, I extol thee.”

     relieve me from their insults 22 and contempt, for I follow thine injunctions.
     Nobles may plan to attack me, 23 but thy servant muses on thine orders;
     my advisers are thine own 24 injunctions—I delight in them.
     My soul is bowed to the dust: 25 revive me, even as thou hast promised;
     teach me thine orders, thou 26 who answerest me when I tell thee of my plight; show me how thy will works, 27 that I may muse upon thy wondrous deeds.
     My sou! is melting under 28 trouble: nerve me, as thou hast promised;

     Teach me, Eternal, how thine 33 orders run, and I will follow them step by step; instruct me how to carry out 34 thy law, and with my whole heart I will keep it; lead me along in thine obedi- 35 ence, for this is my joy.
     Incline my heart to thy behests, 36 and to no love of gain, make me alive to follow thee, 37 and turn mine eyes from cravings vain.
     Fulfil thy promise to thy serv- 38 ant, to advance thy faith;

     Thou art good and doest good, 68 teach me thine orders;
     proud men bespatter me with 69 lies, but I carry out thy behests;
     their minds are gross and dull, 70 but I thrill to thy law.
     It is good for me to have been in 71 trouble—-to learn thy will;
     thy law means more to me 72 than piles of gold and silver.
     Thy hands made and moulded 73 me, to understand thine orders;
     may thy worshippers rejoice 74 to see me waiting on thy word!
     Just are thy dealings, I know-— 75 thou wert faithful in afflict­ing me;
     but now console me with thy 76 love, as thou hast promised thy servant;
     let thy compassion bring me 77 life, for my delight is in thy law.
     Confound the arrogant who ill- 78 treat me, as I muse on thy behests;

     perfect, that I may not be disgraced.
         81 	My soul pines for thy saving aid,
         I 	am waiting for thy promise;
         79 	I pine with looking for thy
     promises; when wilt thou comfort me?
         80 	Though shrivelled like a wine­

     When wilt thou doom my persecutors?
         82 	Insolent creatures, reckless of
     thy law, they dig pitfalls for me;
         83 	help me against their wanton
     wiles, O faithful lawgiver!
         84 	They nearly made an end of me,
     but I would not give up thy laws;
         85 	as thou art loving, revive me,
     and I will do thy bidding.
         86 	O thou Eternal, evermore thy

     study thy behests;
         92 	the ungodly lie in wait to kill
     me, but I pay close heed to thine orders.
         93 	I see a limit to all things, but
     thy law has a boundless range.
     Oh how I love thy law! I 97
     muse upon it all day long;
     thy commands make me 98 wiser than my foes; I am never without them.
     I have more insight than all 99 these oracles, for I muse on thine injunctions!
     I know more than these 10c sages, for I carry out thy behests!
     I avoid all evil courses, that I ioi may do thy bidding;
     thou art my teacher, never 102 can I swerve from thine in­structions.
     How sweet thy sayings are, 103 sweeter than honey to the taste!
     I learn sense from thy be- 104 bests, learn to hate god­less ways.
     Thy law is a lamp for my feet, a 105 light on my path;
     I swore to follow thy just 106 decrees, and I will do it;
     revive me as thou hast prom- 107 ised, O Eternal, in my great misery.
     Accept the vows I breathe to 108 thee, and teach me thy decrees;
     my life is ever in danger, but 109 I never forget thy law;
     ungodly men set snares for no me, but I never give up thine orders.
     I have a lasting heritage in thy in commands, they are my heart’s delight;
     I set myself to execute thine 112 orders ever, at every step.
     I hate men who are half and 113 half, I love thy law;
     I await thy promise, thou 114 my shield and shelter.
     Begone, you villains, let me 115 keep my God’s com­mands!
         116 	Uphold me, as thou hast prom­
     ised, disappoint not my hope, but let me live;
         117 	hold me up safe, let me de­
     light for ever in thy will. 1x8 All who swerve from thy will, thou spumest; their no­tions end in nothing.
         119 	I count all the ungodly so
     much dross; I love thy ride and order;
         120 	my being shudders before
     thee, in awe of thy judg­ments.
         121 	Leave me not to be oppressed,
     for I have done right and justice;
         122 	pledge thy word to succour

     behests, I hate all godless ways.
         129 	Thy laws are a wondrous mys­

         130 	the interpretation of thy
     words enlightens and in­structs the open-minded;
         131 	and I am open, eager, pant­

         132 	Turn to me and have pity—it
     is due to those who love thee;
         133 	direct my steps as thou hast
     promised, free from evil influence;
     deliver me from man’s op- 134 pression, that I may do thy behests.
     Smile on thy servant, teach thy 13S laws to me;
     when men are disobedient to 136 thy law, mine eyes stream with tears.
         O 	thou Eternal, thou art just, 137
     thy sentences are true;
     the rules thou hast enjoined 138 are just and absolutely sure.
     Zeal carries me away, when my 139 foes forget thy laws;
     thy promises are tried and 140 true, thy servant loves them;
         I 	am weak and despised, but 141 I never forget thy be­hests.
     Thy justice is eternal justice, 142 and thy law is truth it­self;
     trouble and anguish seize me, 143 but thy commands are my comfort;
     thy laws are ever just; let me 144 know them and so live.
     Answer me as I cry with all my 145 heart, for I would obey thine orders;

         O 	am up before the dawn to 147
     pray, waiting for thy promises;
         I 	waken through the night to 148 muse upon thy word;
     oh listen—thou art kind; re- 149 vive me—thou art just.
     My pursuers draw near in mal- 150 ice, far away from thy law;
     but, O Eternal, thou art near, 151 all thy commands are true;
         I 	have long seen that thy 152 decrees are valid for all time.
         153 	Look at what I suffer, save me,
     for I never forget	thy
     law;

     me as thou hast promised.
         155 	The ungodly are far from help,
     for they have no mind to thy laws;
         156 	O Eternal, rich in pity, re­
     vive me—thou art just;
         157 	I never swerve from	thy
     control, though many	per­
     secute and press me.
         158 	I loathe apostates, when I see
     how they will not obey thy law;
         159 	look at my own love for thy
     law, and in thy love revive me;
         160 	the sum of thy commands is
     truth, and all thy just commands are ever bind­ing.
         161 	Nobles persecute me wantonly,

     hor, but I do love thy law.
         164 	Seven times a day I praise thee
     for the justice of thy rule;
         165 	right well they fare who
     love thy law; their road is clear.
         166 	I do thy bidding, O Eternal,
     and I hope for thy deliv­erance;
         167 	my soul obeys thy laws, I
     love them dearly;
         168 	I obey thy laws and thy be­
     hests, I live all my life under thine eye.
         169 	Let my cry come before thee, O
     Eternal, enlighten me as thou hast promised;
         170 	let my entreaty reach thee,
     and relieve me as thou hast promised.
     Let my lips praise thee for 171 teaching me thine orders; let me sing of thy word, for 172 just are all thy commands; let thy hand come to my 173 help, for I have chosen to obey thee.
     I am longing for thy help, O thou Eternal, and thy law is my delight;
     let me live that I may 175 praise thee, help me by thy judgments;
     seek out thy servant in his 176 wanderings, for I forget not thy commands.
     A •pilgrim song.
     I cried to the Eternal minA my woe—and the	1
     Eternal answered me—
     “Save me from lying lips and 2 crafty tongues!”
     What will you get from Him, O 3 crafty tongue, what punish­ment in full?
     Sharp arrows poured on you, 4 and burning coals!
     Alas, I have to dwell in Me- 5 shek!
     Alas, I have to live in Kedar’s tents!
     Too long have I been living 6 where men hate peace;
     however peaceably I talk, they 7 are for war.
     A pilgrim song.
     I lift mine eyes to the 1 ni 1 mountains; ah, where is help to come from?
     Help comes from the Eternal 2 who made heaven and earth.
     Never will he let you slip; he 3 who guards you never sleeps:
     he who guards Israel will 4 neither sleep nor slumber.
     The Eternal guards you, shel- 5 tering you upon the right;
         6 	the sun shall never hurt you in
     the day, nor the moon by night.
         7 	The Eternal will guard you
     from all harm, he will pre­serve your life;
         8 	he will protect you as you come
     and go, now and for ever­more.
     A -pilgrim song, by David.
         1 	ian I am glad whenever
     they tell me, “We go to the Eternal’s house,” a glad when our feet stand at last inside Jerusalem—
         1 	Jerusalem that is now rebuilt, a
     city solid and unbroken.
         2 	Thither go the clans on pilgrim­
     age, the Eternal’s clans,
         3 	to offer the Eternal praise, as he
     prescribed for Israel [[there were the seats of justice, the royal tribunals of Da­vid]].
     .6 Pray for the welfare of Jerusa­lem, “May all thy homes be safe,
         7 	may all go well within thy walls,
     within thy palaces!”
         8 	For the sake of my friends and
     fellows I pray, “May all be well with thee!”
         9 	For the sake of the house of our
     God the Eternal, I would have thee prosper.
     A pilgrim song.
     lino To thee I lift mine eyes, enthroned in
     heaven.
         1 	As the eyes of servants are fixed
     on the hand of their lord,
     and as a maid’s eyes on the hand of her mistress,
     so our eyes look to our God, the Eternal, till he take pity on us.
     Take pity on us, O Eternal, oh 3 take pity;
     for we have had our fill, and 4 more, of scorn and sneers,
     from arrogant creatures living at their ease.
     A pilgrim song, by David.
     “Had not the Eternal 1	1
     been upon our side”—
     so let Israel say—
     “had not the Eternal been upon 2 our side,
     when men rose to attack us,
     they would have swallowed us 3 alive,
     so fierce their anger flamed;
     the floods would have swept us 4 away,
     the streams would have surged over us,
     surging clean over us,	5
     with proud, wild waves.
     But, blessed be the Eternal!	6
     he did not leave us for their teeth to tear;
     we escaped like a bird from the 7 fowler’s snare— the snare broke, we escaped!
     Our help lies in the Eternal, 8
     who made heaven and earth!”
     A pilgrim song.
     Those who trust in the inp i Eternal are like Sion hill, never to be shaken;
     Jerusalem sits enthroned for 2 ever, with the hills around her,
     and the Eternal is around his people now and evermore.
     He 'null not leave the land of the 3 just under the sway of knaves;
     or else just men themselves might take to evil.
         O 	thou Eternal, be good to the 4 good, to those who are upright in heart;
     5 as for the shifty and disloyal— may the Eternal scatter them [[with evildoers, and Israel prosper]]!
     A ;pilgrim song.
         1 	I When the Eternal
     brought the exiles back to Sion,
     we were like men who dreamed;
         2 	laughter filled our lips,
     shouts of joy were on our tongues;
     the very heathen said,
     “The Eternal has done great things for them.”
         3 	Yes, great things he had done
     for us,
     and we rejoiced at it.
         4 	O thou Eternal, bring back now
     the rest of our exiles, to fill us up, like streams in the dry south.
         5 	Those who are sowing in tears
     shall reap with shouts of joy;
         6 	sadly they bear seed to the field,
     gladly they bear home the sheaves.
     A pilgrim song, by Solomon.
     i i eyrj Unless the Eternal • builds the house, workmen build in vain; unless the Eternal guards the town,
     sentries are on guard in vain.
     a Vain is it to rise early for your work,
     and keep at work so late, gaining your bread with anxious toil!
     God’s gifts come to his loved ones, as they sleep.
     *• * *
         1 	Sons are a gift of the Eternal, and children are a boon from him.
     Strong sons, born when one is 4 young,
     are like arrows in an archer’s hand;
     happy the man who has a quiver 5 full of them,
     he need not fear to face a hostile band.
     A pilgrim song.
     Happy is everyone who 1 OO 1 reveres the Eternal, L“t) who fives His life!
     You shall earn your daily bread, 2 you happy man and pros­perous!
     Your wife within your house	3
     shall be like a fruitful vine;
     your children, round your table, like slips of olive evergreen.
     Here is the blessing	4
     for one who reveres the Eter­nal!
     The Eternal will send you this 5 blessing from Sion; you shall see Jerusalem flour­ish all your days, you shall five to see your 6 children’s children.
     [[May Israel prosper!]]
     A pilgrim song.
     “Cruelly have they har- T OQ 1 ried me from my youth”— so let Israel say—
     “cruelly have they harried me 2 from my youth, but they have never crushed me.
     The ploughmen ploughed my 3 back,
     and long they drew their furrows;
     but the Eternal, he is just, 4
     he has cut down the ungodly.”
     May all who hate Sion be 5 routed and shamed! let them fare like grass-blades 6 on a roof,
     that fade ere ever they flourish,
         O 	that fill no reaper’s arms,

         1 	No, I have soothed and stilled

     A pilgrim song.
     For David’s sake, Ol 09 65 thou Eternal, re- member all his piety,
     how he swore to the Eternal, 2 vowing to the Mighty One of Jacob,
     “I will not enter my house, I 3 will not lie on my bed,
         1 	will not close my eyes in sleep, 4
     I will not shut my eyelids,
     till I find some residence for the 5 Eternal, some dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
     We heard of the ark at Ephra- 6 thah, we found it in the woodland;
     we went to where he dwelt, and 7 at his footstool knelt:
     “Ascend, Eternal, to thy rest- 8 ing-place, thou and thy mighty ark!—
     thy priests in triumphant array, 9 thy worshippers loudly re­joicing!
     For the sake of thy servant io David, reject not thine own king.”
     The Eternal swore an oath to xi David, and he will not break his word:
     “I will set one of your own sons upon your throne;
     and if your sons will keep my 12 compact and the laws I teach them,
     their sons shall also sit for ever on your throne.”
     For the Eternal has chosen Sion 13 as the seat that he desires;
         12 	“Here is my resting-place,” he
     says, “the seat I choose for evermore;
         13 	I will enrich her food-supplies,
     and satisfy her poor with bread.
         14 	I will robe her priests in tri­
     umph, and make her wor­shippers shout for joy.
         15 	There will I make David’s dy­
     nasty flourish, and my chosen king shine prosper­ously;
         16 	his foes I shroud with dark dis­
     grace, but his own crown shall sparkle.”

     that flows down Aaron’s beard, down to the very collar of his robe;
         3 	vital as dew of Hermon,

     the blessing of an endless life. A pilgrim song.

     Praise the Eternal, he is good; 3 sing to his name, for he is gracious;
     the Eternal has chosen Jacob to 4 be his,
     and Israel as his prized pos­session.
     We know the Eternal is great, 5 and our Lord high over all gods.
     The Eternal does whate’er he 6 pleases,
     in heaven and earth, the seas and all abysses;
     he makes mists rise from the 7 ends of the earth, sends lightning to bring on the rain,
     and wind out of his store­houses.
     ’Twas he who killed the first- 8 born within Egypt, both of man and beast, who sent portents upon Egypt, 9 on the Pharaoh and on all his servants;
     many a nation he struck down, 10 and mighty kings he slew,
     Sihon king of the Amorites, n Og the king of Bashan, and all the powers of Canaan, giving their land to Israel,	12
     to his people to possess.
     Thy name, O thou Eternal, lives 13 for ever,
     thy fame from age to age; the Eternal will right his peo- 14 pie’s wrongs,
     he will be sorry for his serv­ants.

     with eyes—but they cannot see,
         14 	with ears—but they cannot hear,
     with no breath in their lips!

     with all who trust in them!

     when our tyrants asked for a 3 song;

     thou art on every side, behind 5 me and before,
     laying thy hand on me.
     Such knowledge is too wonder- 6 ful for me;
     it is far, far beyond me.
     Where could I go from thy 7 Spirit,
     where could I flee from thy face?
     I climb to heaven?—but thou 8 art there;
         1 	nestle in the nether­world?—and there thou art!
     If I darted swift to the dawn, 9
     to the verge of ocean afar,
     thy hand even there would fall 10 on me,
     thy right hand would reach me.
     xi If I say, “The dark will screen me,
     night will hide me in its cur­tains,”
     is yet darkness is not dark to thee, the night is clear as daylight.
     141 praise thee for the awful wonder of my birth; thy work is wonderful.
         1 	For thou didst form my being,
     didst weave me in my mother’s womb.
         2 	Thou knewest all about my soul,
         3 	my body was no mystery to
     thee,
     as I was being moulded secretly and put together in the world below;
         4 	all the days of my life were fore­
     seen by thee, set down within thy book; ere ever they took shape, they were assigned me, ere ever one of them was mine.
         5 	O God, what mysteries I find in
     thee!
     How vast the number of thy purposes!
         6 	I try to count them?—they are
     more than the sand;
     I wake from my reverie, and I am still lost in thee.
         7 	O God, that thou would’st slay
     the ungodly,
     and bid blood-thirsty men be­gone from me!—
         8 	men who defy thee lawlessly,
     rising up against thee!
         9 	Shall I not hate all who hate
     thee, Eternal,
     shall I not loathe these rebels?
         10 	I hate them with a perfect
     hatred,
     I count them enemies to my­self.
         11 	Search me, O God, and know
     my heart,
     test me and try my thoughts;
     see if I am taking a wrong 24
     course,
     and do thou lead me on the fines of fife eternal.
     From the Choirmaster’s collec­tion. A song of David.
     From evil men deliver 1 ^ A 1 me, O Eternal, xffrvr save me from violent men, from those who in their hearts 2 plot evil,
     all the time making mischief, their tongue sharp as a snake, 3 with vipers’ venom on their lips.
     Preserve me, O Eternal, from 4 the grip of the ungodly, save me from outrageous men, who plan to overthrow me, from the arrogant who set a trap 5 for me,
     and spread their nets to catch me,
     their snares beside my path,
     “Thou art my God,” I cry to the 6 Eternal,
     “oh listen to my plea.
     Eternal One, my Lord, my sav- 7 ing strength,
     who screenest me against attack,
     let not ungodly men have their 8 desires,
     let not their plots succeed!”
     When they dare to beset me, 9 may their own intrigues over­whelm them!
     God rain upon them burning 10 coals!
     God hurl them down, never to rise again!
     Away with slanderers! may vio- n lent men
     be hunted from one woe to another!
     They shall find the Eternal 12 champions
     the rights of the forlorn and feeble.
     13 Just men shall one day give thee thanks for this, and upright men shall dwell within thy presence.
     A song of David.
         1 	1^1 Eternal One, I call thee,
     hasten to me; listen, when I call thee.
         2 	Let my prayer rise like incense
     before thee,
     my lifted hands like the eve­ning sacrifice.
         3 	Set a watch upon my mouth, O
     thou Eternal,
     guard thou the door of my lips;
         4 	may I have no mind to evil,
     to take part in godless doings.
         5 	When good men wound us and
     reprove us, ’tis a kindness; I would pray ever to have their goodwill.
         1 	But as for evildoers, never would I taste their feasts, never would I be their guest.
         1 	[[They are given over to their
     tyrants—
     to teach them that the Eter­nal’s threats are true;
         2 	their bones lie scattered for the
     grave to swallow, like stones splintered and crushed upon the road!]]
         3 	O Lord, I turn mine eyes to thee;
     let me not perish, I am shelter­ing with thee.
         4 	Save me from the snare they
     laid,
     from evildoers and their trap; 10 let the ungodly fall into their own net,
     while I pass on rejoicing!
     An ode or prayer of David, when he was in the cave.
     1	I cry aloud to the Eter-
     loudly I entreat him,
     I pour out before him my plaint, 2 and tell him all my trouble, when my spirits faint.	3
     They have laid a hidden snare for me
     on the road I have to go;
     I look to right and left,	4
     but no man cares to know; all help has failed me, none cares for my life.
     But thou knowest my path, 3 Eternal One, I cry to thee; 5 I say, “Thou art my help,
     I have thee as my very own, in the land of the living.
     Oh listen to my cry,	6
     for I am brought very low;
     save me from my pursuers, they are too strong for me; bring me from my prison,	7
     that I may praise thee; for good men are waiting till thou deal kindly with me.”
     A song of David.
         O thou Eternal, hear my prayer,
     listen to my entreaties, as thou art faithful and true, oh answer me;
     put not thy servant on his trial, 2 for before thee no living soul can be acquitted.
     The foe pursues me,	3
     stamps me to the ground; he forces me to dwell in dark­ness,
     like those who have been dead for long.
     And so my spirits faint,	4
     my heart grows numb within me.
         1 	remember the days of old, 5 I meditate on all that thou
     hast done,
     I muse on what thy hands have wrought;
         6 	and I stretch my hands to thee,
     my soul thirsts for thee like dry land;
         7 	make haste to answer me.
     O thou Eternal, my spirits are failing,
     withhold not thy favour from me,
     lest I become like a dying man.
         8 	Satisfy me with the dawn of
     thy love,
     for in thee do I trust: teach me what is the road to take,
     for my heart is set on thee;
         9 	O thou Eternal, save me from my foes,
     I flee to thee for refuge;
         10 	teach me to do thy will,
     thou art my God; guide me by thy good Spirit on a straight road;
         11 	O thou Eternal, as thou art thy­
     self, revive me, as thou art faithful, bring me out of trouble;
         12 	in love to me, wipe out my foes,
     destroy all who harass me— for I am thy servant.
     A song of David.
         1 	1 /f /t Blest be the Eternal J- *1' One, my Strength,
     who trains my hands to war, my fingers how to fight!—
         2 	my Crag, my Stronghold, my
     Fortalice and Deliverer, the Shield behind whom I shelter,
     the Subduer of nations before me!
         3 	[[What is man that thou
     should’st care for him, or mortal man that thou should’st think of him?
     Man is like a passing breath, 4 his days are like a flitting shadow.]]
     Eternal One, come down upon 5 the bending heavens, touch the mountains till they smoke,
     flash lightning out to scatter my 6 foes,
     shoot thine arrows to discom­fit them;
     reach from on high to raise me 7 from these floods, rescue me from these alien hordes,
     with lies upon their lips,	8
     with right hand raised in a false oath!
     O God, I would sing thee a new 9 song,
     and play to thee on a ten­stringed lute,
     O thou who makest kings vie- io torious,
     who savest thy servant Da­vid.
     Save me from peril of the sword, rescue me from these alien ii hordes,
     with lies upon their lips, with right hand raised in a false oath!

     May our sons be straight and 12 strong like saplings, our daughters like cornices carved in a palace!
     May our barns be bursting with 13 all sorts of produce, may our sheep in the fields mul­tiply in myriads!
     May our rulers be strong, may 14 nothing go wrong— no raids or retreats, no panic in our streets!
     Happy the nation that so fares! 15 Happy the nation whose God is the Eternal!
     A song of praise, by David.
         1 	liffl will extol thee, my ±40 God, O King,
     and bless thee for ever and ever;
         2 	all the day long will I bless thee,
     and praise thee for ever and ever.
         3 	Great is the Eternal, loudly to
     be praised,
     his greatness is unsearchable.
         4 	One age shall praise thy doings
     to another,
     uttering thy mighty acts,
         5 	dwelling on the glorious splen­
     dour of thy state, and on thy marvellous doings;
         6 	they shall proclaim thine awful
     powers,
     and tell thy mighty deeds;
         7 	they shall spread the fame of
     thy great goodness, and sing songs of thy faithful­ness.
         8 	The Eternal is gracious and
     pitiful,
     slow to be angry, very kind;
         9 	the Eternal is good to all who
     look to him,
     and his compassion covers all that he has made, xo All whom thou hast made shall praise thee, O Eternal, thy faithful followers shall bless thee,
         11 	telling of thy glorious kingdom,
     talking of thy might,
         12 	letting men hear of thy mighty
     acts,
     of the glorious splendour of thy kingdom.
         13 	Thy kingdom is an everlasting
     kingdom,
     and thy dominion lasts from age to age.
     The Eternal is true to all his
     promises,
     and kind in all his dealings;
         14 	the Eternal holds up any who
     are falling,
     and raises all who are bowed down.
     All thy creatures look to 15 thee,
     for their food in season due,
     and from thine open hand	16
     they feast upon thy favour.
     Faithful in all his dealings is the 17 Eternal,
     loving in all he does;
     the Eternal is near all who call 18 on him,
     who call on him sincerely;
     he satisfies his worshippers,	19
     he hears their cry and helps them;
     the Eternal preserves all who 20 love him,
     but all the ungodly he de­stroys.
     My lips shall pour out the Eter- 2t nal’s praise;
     let all men bless his sacred name for ever.
     Hallelujah, i	1
     Praise the Eternal, O ±40 my soul!
     As long as I live, I will praise 2 the Eternal,
     and sing to my God, as long as I survive.
     Rely not upon great men—	3
     mere mortals who can give no help;
     when their breath goes, they re- 4 turn to the dust, and on that very day their projects perish.
     Happy the man whose help is 5 Jacob’s God,
     whose hope lies in the Eternal One, his God,
     Maker of heaven and earth 6 and sea, and all they hold.
     He remains ever true, he rights those who are 7 wronged,
     he feeds those who are hungry;
     the Eternal sets the captives free.
         1 	the Eternal gives the blind
     their sight,
     the Eternal raises those who are bowed down,
         2 	the Eternal preserves poor
     foreigners,
     the widow and the orphan he relieves,
         8 	the Eternal loves those who are
     good,
         9 	but the ungodly life he ruins. io The Eternal shall be king for
     ever,
     thy God, O Sion, for all ages. Hallelujah.

     J-*±! 4 Praise the Eternal, for he is good;
     make melody to our God, for he is gracious.
         2 	The Eternal restores Jerusalem,
     he gathers the outcasts of Is­rael,
         3 	he heals the broken-hearted
     and binds up their wounds.
         4 	He fixes the number of the stars,
     and gives a name to each.
         5 	Great is our Lord, mighty in
     power,
     his wisdom is unsearchable.
         6 	The Eternal has relief for the
     afflicted,
     he brings the ungodly to the ground.
         7 	Sing thanks to the Eternal,
     make melody to our God upon the lyre,
         8 	who covers the sky with clouds,
     provides rain for the earth, till grass grows on the very hills,
     and fodder for the beasts that serve mankind,
         9 	who gives wild animals their
     food,
     that cry for it at eventide, io He cares not for the strength of the war-horse,
     delights not in man’s armour;
     the Eternal delights in those ii who revere him, who trust to his own goodness.
     Praise the Eternal, O Jerusalem, 12 praise your God, O Sion; for he has fortified your gate- 13
     ways,
     and blessed your citizens within,
     has made Peace guard your 14 boundaries,
     and filled you with the finest wheat.
     He issues his commands to 15 earth,
     his orders run apace, showering snow white as wool, 16 scattering hoar-frost thick as ashes,
     casting hail-stones down like 17 crumbs.
     The waters freeze; he sends an order, and they 18 melt;
     once he makes the wind blow, then the waters flow.
     He makes his purpose known to 19 Jacob,
     his orders and his laws to Is­rael;
     never has he done so to other 20 nations—
     they know not his commands.
     Hallelujah. *| a o i Praise the Eternal from the heavens,
