\v 1
\q1 "Happy the man who never goes by the advice of the ungodly, who never takes the sinners’ road, nor joins the company of scoffers,
\v 2
\q1 but finds his joy in the Eternal’s law, poring over it day and night.
\v 3
\q1 He is like a tree planted by a stream, that bears fruit in due season, with leaves that never fade; whatever he does, he prospers.
\v 4
\q1 Not so the ungodly! No, they are like chaff swept away by the wind;
\v 5
\q1 when judgments come, the ungodly shall not stand, nor shall the sinful last in the community of the just.
\v 6
\q1 The Eternal cares for the life of the just, but the ungodly life shall perish.
\c 2
\v 1
\q1 Why are pagans seething, nations vainly plotting,
\v 2
\q1 headed by kings of the world, by monarchs making plans
\q2 against the Eternal and his chosen one,
\v 3
\q1 crying, “Let us snap their ties,
\q2 and fling off their control”?
\v 4
\q1 Throned in heaven, he laughs,
\q2 the Lord mocks at them;
\v 5
\q1 then in wrath he speaks to them,
\q2 scares them with his fury.
\v 7
\q1 The Eternal’s edict let me tell:
\v 6
\q2 “I, I have installed my king
\q2 on Sion, on my sacred hill.”
\v 7
\q1 Let me tell the Eternal’s message:
\q2 “You are now my son,
\q2 this day am I your father;
\v 8
\q1 ask, and I make you master of pagans,
\q2 lord over all to the ends of the earth;
\v 9
\q1 you can maul them with an iron mace,
\q2 and shatter them like potter’s ware!”
\p
\v 10
\q1 So, kings, be wise;
\q2 you rulers of the world, take warning;
\v 11
\q1 worship the Eternal reverently,
\q2 shudder and submit to him,
\v 12
\q1 do homage to him truly, lest he be angry,
\q2 and you end in ruin;
\q1 for his anger quickly flames--
\q2 happy are all who shelter beside him!
\p
\s1 A song of David, when he was flying from his son Absalom.
\c 3
\v 1
\q1 How many foes have I, O thou Eternal!
\q2 Many rise against me,
\v 2
\q1 many are saying of me,
\q2 “There is no help for him in God.”
\v 3
\q1 Ah, but thou shieldest me, O thou Eternal,
\q2 in triumph, thou whom I do glorify!
\v 4
\q1 When I call out to the Eternal,
\q2 he answers me from his sacred hill.
\p
\v 5
\q1 I laid me down to sleep,
\q2 and this morning I waken, for the Eternal upholds me;
\v 6
\q1 I fear not thousands of the foe
\q2 ranged all around me.
\v 7
\q1 My enemies thou wilt all disable,
\q2 and the ungodly thou wilt crush.
\v 7
\q1 Up, O Eternal, to the rescue!
\v 8
\q1 ’Tis for the Eternal to bring help:
\q2 my God, thy blessing be upon thy people!

\v 1
\q1 O God, my champion, answer my appeal.
\q2 When I was hemmed in, thou hast freed me often;
\q2 be gracious to me now and hear my prayer.
\p
\v 2
\q1 Proud men, how long will you be so misguided,
\q2 loving to deal in libels, eager on vain intrigues?
\p
\v 3
\q1 Look how the Eternal marks me out for favour!
\q2 The Eternal listens when I call to him.
\v 4
\q1 Tremble at it and give over sinning,
\q2 bethink yourselves at night and hold your peace;
\v 5
\q2 offer true sacrifice and trust the Eternal.
\p
\v 6
\q1 Many long for a sight of prosperous days;
\q2 “Only look up and smile on us, Eternal!”
\v 7
\q1 My heart thou hast already given more joy
\q2 than theirs who harvest corn and store new wine.
\v 8
\q1 So quietly I lay me down to sleep,
\q2 for even alone, thanks to thee, I am secure.
\p
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. For flutes. A song of David.
\c 5
\v 1
\q1 O thou Eternal, listen to my words,
\q2 and hear the murmur of my soul;
\v 2
\q1 my King and God, give ear to my appeal,
\q2 for I am calling out to thee;
\v 3
\q1 oh hear my morning prayer,
\q2 for in the morning I set forth my plea,
\q2 waiting thine answer.
\p
\v 4
\q1 Thou art no God to take delight in vice,
\q2 no evil man is any guest of thine,
\v 5
\q1 no arrogance can look thee in the face;
\v 6
\q1 all wrongdoers and lying men thou hatest,
\q2 craft and bloodshed thou abhorrest;
\v 7
\q1 but I have access to thy house, by thy great generosity,
\q2 I can bow reverently before thy sacred shrine.
\p
\v 8
\q1 O thou Eternal, let not my foes thwart me,
\q2 lead thou me on, as thou art just,
\q2 make thy path smooth before me.
\v 9
\q1 For in their talk there is no truth,
\q2 their hearts are deep with mischief,
\q1 their throats are open graves--smooth-tongued deceivers!
\v 10
\q1 O God, condemn them;
\q2 let their own plots end them.
\q1 Down with them,	for	their many crimes,
\q2 rebelling against thee!
\p
\v 11
\q1 So all who shelter with thee shall rejoice,
\q2 and under thy protection sing for joy;
\q2 lovers of thy name ever exult in thee.
\v 12
\q1 For thou wilt bless the just, O thou Eternal,
\q2 shielding them safe,
\q2 crowning them with thy favour.

\c 6
\v 1
\q1 Punish me not in anger, O Eternal,
\q2 do not chastise me in hot rage;
\v 2
\q1 have pity on me, Eternal, in my weakness,
\q1 oh heal me, for my health is broken,
\v 3
\q2 my soul is in an anguish of dismay.
\p
\q1 Ah, why art thou so long of helping?
\v 4
\q1 O thou Eternal, save my life once more;
\q2 for thy love’s sake, succour me;
\v 5
\q1 for in death’s realm there is no thought of thee,
\q2 and who can praise thee in the world below?
\p
\v 6
\q1 I faint with moaning,
\q2 every night my bed is drenched with tears,
\q2 my couch is wet with them;
\v 7
\q1 trouble wears away my strength,
\q2 I age under outrages from my foes.
\p
\v 8
\q1 “Begone, all of you, evildoers!
\q2 The Eternal listens to my wail,
\v 9
\q2 the Eternal will receive my prayer.”
\v 10
\q1 My foes shall all be utterly dismayed,
\q2 and suddenly discomfited once more.
\s1 A dithyramb of David, sung to the Eternal, about the taunts of Cush the Benjamite.
\c 7
\v 1
\q1 I shelter with thee, Eternal One, my God;
\q2 keep me safe from my pursuer,
\v 2
\q1 lest he tear me like a lion,
\q2 devouring me, with none to rescue.
\p
\v 3
\q1 If I did it, Eternal One, my God,
\q2 if I am guilty of injustice,
\v 4
\q1 if I ill-treated my friend,
\q2 if I made havoc of my foe for no cause,
\p
\v 5
\q1 then let the foe chase me,
\q2 then let the foe catch me,
\q1 let him trample my life to the ground,
\q2 let him lay me low in the dust!
\p
\v 6
\q1 [[Bestir thyself in anger, O Eternal,
\q2 in outbursts of fury against our foes;
\q2 awake to aid us, to maintain the right.
\p
\v 7
\q1 Summon all nations before thee;
\q2 be seated on thy lofty throne,
\v 8
\q2 O thou Eternal, thou judge of the world!
\p
\q1 Right our cause, we are innocent,
\q2 do justice, thou, to our integrity--
\v 9
\q2 ah, end the malice of the ungodly!
\p
\q1 The God of justice reads the inmost heart;
\v 10
\q2 God shields us, he who saves io the upright heart;
\v 11
\q2 God is a just God, every day indignant.]]
\p
\v 12
\q1 There he is, whetting his sword again!
\q2 His bow is strung and stretched,
\v 13
\q1 his deadly darts are ready,
\q2 his arrows are fire-tipped;
\p
\14
\q1 the scoundrel is alive with malice,
\q2 hatching mischief and deception;
\v 15
\q1 he digs out a deep pit--
\q2 and into his own pitfall shall he tumble!
\p
\v 16
\q1 His mischief shall recoil on his own head,
\q2 his violence shall drop on his own crown;
\v 17
\q1 while I thank the Eternal for his retribution,
\q2 and praise the Eternal, the Most High.

\v 1
\q1 O thou Eternal One, our Lord,
\q2 what majesty is thine o’er all the world!
\v 2
\q1 High in heaven thou hast set thy splendour,
\v 3
\q2 to check thy foes, to crush the rebels.
\q1 Let me sing of this, thy heavenly strength,
\v 2
\q2 like tiny children lisping out thy praise;
\v 3
\q1 for, as I look up to the heavens
\q2 thy fingers made, the moon and stars that thou hast shaped,
\v 4
\q1 I ask, “And what is man, that thou should’st think of him?
\q2  is a mortal man, that thou should’st heed him?”
\v 5
\q1 Yet thou hast made him little less than divine,
\q2 hast crowned him with majesty and honour,
\v 6
\q1 giving him sway o’er all thy hands have made,
\q2  all things underneath his feet--
\v 7
\q1 sheep and oxen, all of them,
\q2 yes and the wild beasts,
\v 8
\q1 birds of the air and fish of the sea--
\q2 all that swims on the wet sea paths!
\v 9
\q1 thou Eternal One, our Lord,
\q2 what majesty is thine o’er all the world!

\c 9
\p
\v 1
\q1 With all my heart I thank q i thee, O Eternal,
\q2 I will tell over all thy deeds of wonder,
\v 2
\q1 I thrill and triumph in thee,
\q2 singing praise to thee, O thou Most High.
\v 3
\q1 For my foes are routed,
\q2 stumbling to their ruin at thy frown;
\v 4
\q1 thou hast upheld my cause, my rights,
\q2 passing just sentence, seated on thy throne;
\v 5
\q1 thou hast curbed pagans, crushing the ungodly,
\q2 blotting their very name out for all time.
\v 6
\q1 The foe is at an end, no more to be remembered,
\q2 the towns thou hast torn up lie in lasting ruin;
\v 7
\q1 but the Eternal sits enthroned for evermore,
\q2 enthroned for government,
\q1 he governs all the world with justice,
\q2 ruling its folk with equity.
\v 9
\q1 So the downtrodden are safe with the Eternal,
\q2 he is a refuge in desperate hours;
\v 10
\q1 those who know what thou art can trust in thee,
\q2 for never wilt thou abandon those who seek thee.
\p
\v 11
\q1 Sing praise to the Eternal, whose seat is in Sion,
\q2 declare to the nations what he does,
\q1 how he bears you in mind, this Avenger of bloodshed,
\q2 how he never forgets the wail of the weak.
\v 13
\q1 The Eternal has seen what I suffer, and pitied me, lifting me from the very gates of death,
\v 14
\q1 that in the gates of Sion I may chant his praise, exulting in his aid.
\v 15
\q1 The pagans have sunk in the pit they dug;
\q2 in the net they set, their feet are snared.
\v 16
\q1 The Eternal has shown what he is, by a sentence of doom,
\q2 as his hands have trapped the ungodly.
\v 17
\q1 The ungodly must go back to death,
\q2 all pagans who are forgetful of God;
\v 18
\q1 for one day the needy will be remembered,
\q2 the hopes of the downtrodden will not always be disappointed.
\p
\v 19
\q1 Take action, O Eternal, let not man have the upper hand;
\q2 let pagans get their doom from thee!
\v 20
\q1 Strike them with terror, O Eternal,
\q2 let pagans know that they are only men!
\c 10
\v 1
\q1 I A Why art thou standing so far off, O Eternal,
\q2 hiding thyself in desperate hours?
\v 2
\q1 The ungodly are haughty and harry the downtrodden--
\q2 may they be snared in their own schemes!
\v 3
\q1 The ungodly boasts of his rapacity;
\q2 the plunderer disowns, despises the Eternal;
\v 4
\q1 he thinks, in his insolence, “God never punishes”;
\q2 his thoughts amount to this, “There is no God at all”;
\v 5
\q2 the dealings of thy justice high are far beyond his sight.
\q1 Life for him is always stable;
\q2 he laughs at any who oppose him,
\v 6
\q1 thinking he can never fail,
\q2 never come to grief.
\v 7
\q1 His talk is all of perjury and craft,
\q2 mischief and injury slip from his tongue.
\v 8
\q1 He lurks round hamlets,
\q2 and murders innocent folk in secret,
\q2 ever on the outlook for the hapless;
\v 9
\q1 he lies in ambush, like a lion in his lair,
\q2 hiding to catch the weak,
\q2 to catch the weak and drag them off.
\v 10
\q1 He hunts the helpless till they drop,
\q2 unlucky victims, in his clutches.
\v 11
\q1 And he thinks, “God has forgotten,”
\q2 “He hides his face,” “He never sees.”
\v 14
\q1 But thou hast seen this misery and mischief;
\q2 thou markest it, to punish it thyself!
\q1 The hapless can leave their plight to thee,
\q2 thou Helper of the forlorn.
\p
\v 12
\q1 Take action, O Eternal, lift thy hand;
\q2 O God, forget not the afflicted.
\v 13
\q1 How dare ungodly men scorn God,
\q2 thinking that thou wilt never punish?
\v 15
\q1 Shatter the ungodly’s power,
\q2 punish his evil till there is no more.
\v 16
\q1 The Eternal reigns as king for evermore;
\q2 the pagans are gone from his land!
\v 17
\q1 Thou hearest the desire of the afflicted,
\q2 thou heedest them, thou listenest to them,
\v 18
\q1 that the forlorn and the downtrodden may have justice,
\q2 and mortal man no more may be a terror.
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\c 11
\p
\v 1
\q1 With the Eternal I take shelter;
\q2 how dare you tell me, then,
\q2 “Be off, like a bird, to the hills!
\v 2
\q1 Look, impious men bend their bow,
\q2 their arrow is on the string,
\q2 to shoot in the dark at the upright!
\v 3
\q1 The pillars of the State are falling:
\q2 what good can a just man do?”
\p
\v 4
\q1 Ah, but the Eternal is within his sacred palace,
\q2 the Eternal is enthroned in heaven,
\q2 his searching glance is upon mortal men.
\v 5
\q1 On good men the Eternal sets his stamp,
\q2 the impious who love violence he loathes;
\v 6
\q1 on impious men he showers down coals of fire,
\q2 brimstone and scorching blasts fall to their lot.
\v 7
\q1 For just is the Eternal, he loves justice;
\q2 so the upright alone enjoy his favour.
\p
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. For bass voices. A song of David.
\c 12
\p
\v 1
\q1 Help, O Eternal, goodness is no more,
\q2 fidelity has vanished from mankind!
\v 2
\q1 Empty and false are man’s words to his fellow;
\q2 they talk with flattering lips and double minds.
\v 3
\q1 The Eternal cut off every flattering lip,
\q2 and tongues that talk so loftily--
\v 4
\q1 men who declare, “We give rein to our tongues;
\q2 our lips are our own: who calls us to account?”
\p
\v 5
\q1 “The weak are being crushed, the needy sigh;
\q2 So I take action,” says the Eternal One,
\q2 “and set them safe where they long to be.”
\v 6
\q1 And what the Eternal promises is true,
\q2 sterling as silver seven times purified.
\v 7
\q1 So are we kept by thee, O thou Eternal,
\q2 safe ever from this world of men,
\v 8
\q1 where all around us the ungodly strut,
\q2 and where base creatures rise to power.
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\c 13
\p
\v 1
\q1 Eternal One, how long wilt thou forget me?
\q1 How long wilt thou withhold thy favour from me?
\v 2
\q1 How long must I cherish a daily grief?
\q1 How long is my foe to triumph over me?
\v 3
\q1 Look to me, O Eternal One, my God, and answer me;
\q1 revive me, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
\v 4
\q1 lest my foe claim, “I have mastered him,”
\q1 lest my enemies exult over my downfall.
\v 5
\q1 But on thy kindness I indeed rely;
\q1 let me exult over thy saving aid,
\v 6
\q1 let me be singing to the Eternal
\q1 for having dealt with me so lovingly.
\s1 From the Choirmaster’s collection. A song of David.
\c 14
\p
\v 1
\q1 Profane men think,
\q2 “There is no God!”
\q1 Depraved their lives are and detestable,
\q2 not one of them does right.
\v 2
\q1 The Eternal looks from heaven upon mankind,
\q2 to see if any have the sense to care for God.
\p
\v 3
\q1 But all are faithless,
\q2 one and all are tainted;
\q1 not one does right,
\q2 no, not a single one.
\p
\v 4
\q1 Shall they not rue it, all these rascals,
\q2 devouring my people with their extortion?
\v 5
\q1 Ha! there they are in a panic,
\q2 for God is indeed with the godly!
\v 6
\q1 You would baffle these weak folk?
\q2 But the Eternal is their resource.
\p
\v 7
\q1 Oh that Israel’s deliverance would come from Sion!
\q1 When the Eternal restores the fortunes of his people,
\q2 how Jacob will exult,
\q2 how glad will Israel be!
\s1 A song of David.
\c 15
\v 1
\q1 In thy pavilion, O Eternal, who may be a guest,
\q2 who may dwell on thy sacred hill?
\v 2
\q1 He whose life is blameless, who does right,
\q2 he whose words are from the heart--
\v 3
\q1 no scandal on his tongue, to hurt his fellow,
\q2 no insult heaped upon his neighbour;
\v 4
\q1 he has contempt for rogues,
\q2 and honours those who reverence the Eternal;
\q1 he keeps to his oath, though he may lose by it,
\v 5
\q2 he takes no interest on a loan;
\q1 he is not to be bribed against the innocent--
\q2 he, living so, shall never be rejected.
\s1 A golden ode of David.
\c 16
\p
\v 1
\q1 Keep me safe, O God, for with thee I take shelter.
\v 2
\q1 “Thou art my Lord,” I say to the Eternal,
\q2 “my welfare rests on thee alone;
\v 3
\q1 in the saints of the land, thy noble followers,
\q2 is all my delight.”
\v 4
\q1 Sorrow on sorrow is theirs, who choose some other god;
\q2 their bloody libations I will never pour,
\q2 their names I will never mention.
\v 5
\q1 Thou art what I obtain from life, O thou Eternal,
\q2 thou thyself art my share;
\v 6
\q1 fair prospects are allotted me,
\q2 a blissful heritage is mine.
\p
\v 7
\q1 I bless the Eternal for his counsel,
\q2 for teaching me during the very night:
\v 8
\q1 I keep the Eternal at all times before me;
\q2 with him so close, I cannot fail.
\v 9
\q1 And so my heart and soul rejoice,
\q2 my body rests secure;
\q1 for never wilt thou let me sink to death,
\q2 nor leave thy loyal one to the grave;
\v 4
\q1 thou wilt reveal the path to life,
\q2 to the full joy of thy presence,
\q2 to the bliss of being close to thee for ever.
\s1 A prayer of David.
\c 17
\v 1
\q1 Listen to the innocent, Eternal One, and heed our wail,
\q2 hear prayers we pour from honest lips;
\v 2
\q1 speed thy sentence in our favour,
\q2 that our eyes may see it.
\v 3
\q1 q1 For in thine equity thou hast tried our heart,
\q2 searching us out by night;
\q1 thou hast tested us and hast found nothing wrong,
\q2 no evil thought, no sin of speech;
\v 4
\q1 under thy dealings we are silent,
\q2 heeding what thou sayest;
\v 5
\q1 we have kept close to thy track,
\q2 our feet have never faltered;
\v 6
\q1 and so we call on thee, O God, to answer us;
\q2 bend thine ear, listen to our plea.
\p
\v 7
\q1 saviour, in thy kindness interpose,
\q2 those who shelter with thee from their foes;
\v 8
\q1 guard us as thine own eye,
\q2 hide us under the shadow of thy wings,
\v 9
\q1 from the ungodly who would harry us,
\q2 the eager enemies that encircle us.
\v 10
\q1 Their hearts are closed to pity,
\q2 their words are insolent;
\v 11
\q1 at every step they dog us,
\q2 alert to pull us down,
\v 12
\q1 like lions hungry to devour,
\q2 like lions lurking for their prey.
\p
\v 13
\q1 Up, O Eternal, face them, crush them;
\q2 let thy sword save us from ungodly men!
\v 14
\q1 May thy hand slay them, O Eternal,
\q2 sweeping them from the world!
\q1 Yet give them here their due of doom, sating their sons with it,
\q2 let them leave some for their children!
\v 15
\q1 But may our innocent lives enjoy thy favour,
\q2 may we be satisfied, when we wake to see thy vision.
\s1 From the Choirmaster s collection. A song of David the servant of the Eternal, who sang these words to the Eternal on the day when the Eternal rescued him from the power of all his enemies, from the power of Saul. He said:
\v 1
\q1 O Eternal, my Strength, I will exalt thee.
\v 2
\q1 The Eternal is my crag, my stronghold, my deliverer,
\q1 my God, my fortalice where I take shelter,
\q1 my shield, my saving strength, my retreat.
\v 3
\q1 The Eternal is to be praised!-- I call to him,
\q1 and I am rescued from my foes.
\v 4
\q1 For waves of death broke round me,
\q1 floods of destruction burst on me;
\v 5
\q1 deadly nets entangled me,
\q1 and fatal snares surprised me.
\v 6
\q1 I called to the Eternal in my plight,
\q1 I cried to my God for aid;
\q1  in his palace heard my voice,
\q1  cry came to his ears.
\p
\v 7
\q1 The earth was swaying, quaking,
\q1 hills were quivering to their base,
\q1 before his anger shaking;
\v 8
\q1 smoke fumed from his nostrils,
\q2 and scorching fire from his lips,
\q2 that kindled blazing coals,
\v 9
\q1 as down he came on the bending sky,
\q1 the storm-cloud at his feet.
\v 10
\q1 He rode on flying kherubs,
\q1 and swooped with the wings of the wind,
\v 11
\q1 shrouding himself in darkness,
\q1 that veiled his presence round,
\q1 with rain-clouds dark and dense.
\v 12
\q1 Storm-clouds rolled in front of him,
\q2 with hail and lightning flashes,
\v 13
\q1 and from heaven the Eternal thundered,
\q1 the Most High uttered his voice;
\v 14
\q1 he scattered his arrows,
\q1 shot twisting flashes of lightning,
\v 15
\q1 till the beds of the waters were seen,
\q1 and earth’s foundations were laid bare,
\q1 at thy storming, O Eternal,
\q1 the snorting of thy nostrils.
\p
\v 16
\q1 He reaches down to raise me,
\q1  draws me from the flood,
\v 17
\q1 he frees me from my foe so strong,
\q1 from haters far too strong for me,
\v 18
\q1 who assailed me by surprise in my distress;
\q1 but the Eternal comes to my support
\v 19
\q1 and sets me free, in a clear space;
\q1 as he delights in me, he rescues me.
\v 20
\q1 The Eternal deals with me as I am upright,
\q1 he recompenses me for my clean life;
\v 21
\q1 for I have kept to the Eternal’s road,
\q1 and never sinned by swerving from my God;
\v 22
\q1 his rules are all before my mind,
\q1 I never set aside his orders;
\v 23
\q1 I was blameless in his eyes,
\q2 and kept clear of my sins.
\v 24
\q1 So the Eternal has rewarded me
\q1 for my integrity,
\q1 for my life clean in his eyes.
\v 25
\q1 To the kind thou provest kind,
\q1 and true to the true,
\v 26

\q1 and treacherous to the treacherous;
\v 27
\q1 the humble thou wilt raise,
\q2 but the haughty thou wilt abase.
\p
\v 28
\q1 O thou Eternal, thou wilt light my lamp,
\q1 my God, thou wilt make my darkness shine;
\v 29
\q1 by thy help I can face a troop,
\q2 by God’s help I can leap a wall.
\v 30
\q1 God is unerring in his ways,
\q1 the Eternal’s promises are tried and true;
\q1 he shields all who take shelter with him.
\v 31
\q1 For who is God save the Eternal?
\q1 Who is steadfast but our God?--
\v 32
\q1 God who girdles me with strength,
\q1 and clears the path for me.
\v 33
\q1 He makes me nimble as a deer
\q1 and sets me on the height.
\v 34
\q1 He trains me how to fight,
\q1 till I can bend a bow of bronze.
\v 35
\q1 Thou hast shielded me with thine aid,
\q1 thy right hand holds me up;
\q1 thine answers to prayer have raised me.
\v 36
\q1 Thou hast given me room to move, and a foothold sure!
\v 37
\q1 I chase my foes and catch them,
\q1 I never turn till they are killed,
\v 38
\q1 I fell them till they cannot rise;
\q1 they fall down at my feet.
\v 39
\q1 For thou hast braced me for the fray;
\q1 thou makest my assailants drop before me;
\v 40
\q1 thou makest my foes fly, fly before me,
\q1 till I finish off those who hate me.
\v 41
\q1 They cry for help, but there is none to help them,
\q1 cry to the Eternal, but they get no answer;
\v 42
\q1 and I pound them to pieces like dust before the wind,
\q1 I crush them like mud in the street.
\p
\v 43
\q1 Thou hast freed me from feuds,
\q2 and made me head over pagans;
\v 44
\q1 outsiders fawn on me,
\q1 foreigners come cringing to me;
\q1 once they hear of me, they render homage;
\v 45
\q1 foreigners give way,
\q1 and creep trembling from their forts.
\p
\v 46
\q1 The Eternal is living--blest be my Might,
\q2 exalted be my God of victory!--
\v 47
\q1 God who lets me enjoy my vengeance,
\q1 subduing the nation under me.
\v 48
\q1 O thou my rescuer from my foes,
\q1 who settest me high above my enemies,
\q1 who rescuest me from violence,
\v 49
\q1 I thank thee before pagans, O Eternal,
\q1 I will sing thy praise.

\q1 Thou hast given him his heart’s desire,

         1 	Turn thine ear to me,
     delay not to deliver me;
     be a rock of refuge for me, a hill-fort to protect me, for thou art my crag and 3 castle.
     As thou art God, oh lead me, guide me,
     safe from the snares spread 4 cunningly to catch me.
     Thou art my stronghold,
     I put my life into thy hands; 5 and, O Eternal, O thou faith­ful God, thou savest me.
     Those who heed empty idols, 6 thou wilt hate; but in the Eternal I do put my faith.
     I will exult rejoicing in thy love, 7 who hast looked upon my misery
     and thought of my life in ad­versity,
     who hast not left me in the 8 clutches of my foes, but hast set me at liberty.
     Have pity on me, Eternal One; 9 I am in misery, my health is wasting under my woe,
     my life eaten away with sorrow, io and my years with sighing;
     my strength gives way under my punishment, my body falls to pieces.
     I am the scorn of all my foes, n the butt of all my fellows;
     my very friends are horrified, men shun me in the street;
     I am forgotten like a buried 12 corpse,
     flung aside like a discarded pot.
     At every turn I am in terror, 13 for I hear many whisper­ing,
     men making plans against me, plotting to take my life.
     But on thee, O Eternal, I rely; 14 I say, “Thou art my God.”
     My fate lies in thy hands;
     oh rid me of my foes and my
     pursuers,
         16 	smile on thy servant,
     in thy love succour me.
         17 	On thee have I called, O Eternal,
     disappoint me not; disappoint the wicked, send them to the silent grave!
         18 	Strike dumb these lying lips,
     so insolent in pride and scorn against the just!
         19 	What wealth of kindness thou
     hast laid up for thy wor­shippers,
     and shown to those who shelter with thyself!
         20 	Thou hidest them under thy
     wings from human plots, thou shelterest them from the scourge of slander!
         21 	Blessed be the Eternal,
     for wondrous favour shown me in desperate plight.
         22 	In my distraction I cried out,
     “I am cast out of thy sight!” But thou hast heard my loud appeal,
     when I called for help to thee.
         23 	Ah, love the Eternal, all ye
     faithful;
     the Eternal will keep faith with you,
     and richly requite arrogant men.
         24 	Only be strong, be brave,
     all ye who wait for the Eter­nal.
     An ode of David.
         1 	OO Oh the bliss of him whose
     guilt is pardoned, and his sin forgiven!
         2 	Oh the bliss of him whom the
     Eternal has absolved, whose spirit has made full confession!
         3 	So long as I refused to own my
     guilt,
     I moaned unceasingly, life ebbed away;
     for thy hand crushed me night 4 and day,
     my body dried up, as in sum­mer heat.
     Then did I own my sin to thee, 5 uncovering my iniquity;
     and as I vowed I would confess, thou didst remit my sinful guilt.
     So let each loyal heart in trouble 6 pray to thee: the floods may roar, but they will never reach him,
     for thou wilt be his shelter, 7 safeguarding him in peril, surrounding him with aid.
     “I will instruct you and teach 8 you_
     what is the road to take;
     I will give you counsel,
     O humble soul.”
     Be not like mules and colts, 9 that do not understand the bridle,
     unbroken creatures that require a halter’s curb,
     or they will not come near you.
     Many a pang falls to the un- xo godly,
     but he who trusts in the Eter­nal shall enjoy his favour.
     Exult then in the Eternal joy- II fully, ye just,
     and shout for joy, all ye who are upright in heart.
     Rejoice, ye just, in theQQ 1 Eternal,	OO
     for songs of praise befit the upright soul.
     Praise the Eternal on the lyre, 2 sing to him on a ten-stringed lute.

         2 	Sing him a new song,
     strike the strings bravely at the festival.
         3 	For just are all the Eternal’s
     orders,
     and all he does is loyally done;
         4 	he has a love for honesty and
     justice,
     the earth is full of his kind­ness.
         5 	The heavens were made at the
     Eternal’s order, and all their host by his mere word;
         6 	he holds the seas as in a water­
     skin,
     .and stores up the abysses of the deep.
         7 	Let all the earth fear the Eter­
     nal,
     let every dweller stand in awe of him;
         8 	for he it was who spoke—and
     earth existed,
     ’twas at his bidding it ap­peared.
     io	The Eternal wrecks the purposes of pagans,
     he brings to nothing what the nations plan;
     n but the Eternal’s purpose stands for ever,
     and what he plans will last from age to age.
         0 	Happy the nation whose God is
     the Eternal,
     the people he has chosen for his own!
         1 	The Eternal looks from heaven,
     beholding all mankind;
         2 	from where he sits, he scans
     all who inhabit the world;
         3 	he who alone made their minds,
     he notes all they do.
         4 	Armies do not bring victory to
     a king,
     the warrior is not rescued by sheer strength;
     ■cavalry are in vain for vie- 17 tory,
     there is no winning by the strength of that!
     No, the Eternal’s eye rests on 18 his worshippers, who rest their hopes upon his kindness,
     that he may rescue them from 19 death,
     and during famine-days keep them alive.
     And we rest our hopes, on the 20 Eternal,
     we wait for him, our help and shield;
     in him our heart rejoices,	21
     our faith is in his sacred name.
     Thy kindness rest on us, O thou Eternal, as our hope rests in thee!
     A song of David when he feigned madness before Abimelek, who compelled him to go away.
     I will bless the Eternal at 04 1 all times,	_ O'*
     his praise shall be continually on my lips;
     my soul boasts openly of the 2 Eternal,
     and as the humble hear it, they are glad.
     Magnify the Eternal with me, 3 let us exalt him together.
     I besought the Eternal and he 4 answered me,
     he rescued me from all my terrors;
     look to him, and you shall beam 5 with joy,
     you shall never be abashed.
     Here is a poor man whose cry 6 the Eternal heard, and helped him out of all his troubles.
     The angels of the Eternal camp 7 around his worshippers, and rescue them.
         0 	Try the Eternal; you will find
     him kind;
     happy the man who takes shelter with him!
         1 	Revere the Eternal, O ye saints
     of his,
     the reverent never want for anything;
         2 	apostates may be famishing and
     starving,
     but those who turn to the Eternal lack no good.
         3 	Come, listen to me, my sons,
     I will teach you true religion.
         4 	’Tis your desire to live,
     to live long and be happy?
         5 	Then keep your tongue from evil,
     keep your lips from deceit;
         6 	shun evil and do good,
     seek to be friendly—aim at that.
         16 	For the Eternal sets his face
     against evildoers, to root their very name out of the earth;
         0 	but the Eternal turns his eyes
     towards good men, his ears are open to their cry;
         16 	when they cry, the Eternal
     listens,
     he rescues them from all their troubles.
         17 	The Eternal is near the broken­
     hearted,
     and for crushed spirits he has help;
         18 	the good man may have many a
     mishap,
     but from them all the Eternal rescues him.
         19 	He guards every bone of him;
     not one is broken.
         20 	Misfortune is the death of
     wicked men,
     and haters of good men are
     doomed;
         21 	but the Eternal saves his serv­
     ants’ life,
     none who take shelter with him shall be Dunished.
     A song of David.
     Fight those who fight me, *> C? 1 O thou Eternal, OiJ war on those who war on me;
     seize thy shield and buckler, 2 stand up as my champion,
     draw thy spear and battle-axe, 3 to cope with my pursuers;
     say to me, O Eternal,
     “I am your safety.”
     Disgraced, discomfited, be they 4 who seek my life!
     May they be routed and con­founded
     who aim to injure me!
     Scattered be they like chaff be- 5 fore the wind, driven by thine angel!
     Dark and slippery be their road, 6 pursued by thine angel!
     For wantonly they spread their 7 net for me,
     they dug a pitfall wantonly for me.
     May the net they spread en- 8 snare themselves, into their own pit may they 4 fall,
     surprised by ruin!
     Then shall my soul rejoice in the 9 Eternal,
     joyful at his deliverance;
     all my being shall exclaim, 10 “O thou Eternal, who is like thee,
     O rescuer of the weak from stronger powers,
     O rescuer of the wretched from destroyers!”
     Malicious accusers come for- 11 ward,
     charging me with crimes I know naught of;
     they repay me with evil for 12 good,
     rendering me all forlorn.
     When they were ill, I wore the 13 sackcloth,
     I went humbly fasting,
     I prayed for them, with head bent on my breast,
         0 	as for a friend, as for my
     brother;
     downcast was I, in black I dressed,
     like a man mourning for his mother.
         1 	And now, when I fall, they are
     glad,
     and gather to attack me with cruel, cutting charges, of which I know nothing, railing at me unceasingly, re­viling,
         2 	mocking me, gnashing at me
     with their teeth!
         3 	How long wilt thou look on at
     this, O Lord?
     Save me from their loud lies, O thou Eternal, save my unhappy life from human lions!
         4 	Then shall I give thanks to thee
     in our assembly, and praise thee in our throng of worshippers.
         5 	Let not my foes rejoice over me
     wrongfully,
     let not my wanton haters wink maliciously!
         6 	No words of peace are theirs,
     but crafty plots against the peaceable;
         7 	wide-mouthed, they are taunt­
     ing me,
     shouting, “Aha! aha! we see his plight!”
         8 	Eternal One, thou seest it; keep
     not silence;
     Lord, keep not far away;
         9 	rouse thyself wake to do me
     justice,
     to defend my cause, my God;
         10 	do me justice, as thou art just
     thyself,
     that they may never rejoice over me,
     shouting, “Aha! aha! we have 25 our heart’s desire, we have done for him!”
     Disgraced, confounded, may 26 they be
     who delight in my harm!
     Shame and dishonour cover those
     who are insolent to me!
     But may they shout for joy, 27 may they be glad, who love to see me righted!
     May they have ever cause to say,
     “All hail to the Eternal, who loves to see his servant prospering!”
     Then all day long my tongue 28 shall talk
     of thy justice and thy praise.
     From, the Choirmaster’s collec­tion. A song of David.
     An impious spirit inspires O fl 1 the ungodly man; OO there is no fear of God before his eyes.
     He is flattering himself	2
     that his iniquity will never be found out.
     His words are mischievous and 3 deceitful,
     he has now ceased to live wisely and well;
     he plans some mischief as he lies 4 in bed,
     and then he takes a course that is not good— he loathes not evil.
     * * *
     Eternal One, thy love is high as 5
     heaven,
     thy loyalty soars to the very skies,
     thy justice is like mighty moun- 6 tains,
     thy judgments are like the deep sea.
     Thy providence is over man and beast;
         2 	how precious is thy love, O
     God!
     To thee men come for shelter in the shadow of thy wings;
         3 	they have their fill of choice
     food in thy house, the stream of thy delights to drink;
         4 	for life’s own fountain is within
     thy presence,
     and in thy smile we have the light of life.
         5 	Continue thy love to those who
     care for thee,
     thy justice to right-minded men.
         6 	Never let insolence stir a foot
     against us,
     let no ungodly hand drive us afar.
         7 	Yonder they lie, the evildoers,
     felled to the earth, unable to arise!
     A song of David.
         1 	q>7 Fret not over evildoers,
     V * envy not the lawless;
         2 	soon like grass they fade,
     and wither like a green blade.
         3 	Trust in the Eternal and do
     right,
     be loyal to him within his land;
         4 	make the Eternal your delight,
     and he will give you all your heart’s desire.
         5 	Leave all to him, rely on him,
     and he will see to it;
         6 	he will bring your innocence to
     light,
     and make the justice of your cause clear as noonday. 15
     Cease your anger, give up raging, 8 fret not—it only leads to evil.
     Evildoers shall indeed be rooted 9 out,
     and the land left to those who wait for the Eternal.
     A little longer, and the godless io will be gone;
     look in his haunts, and he is there no more!
     The land will be left to the ii humble,
     to enjoy plenteous prosperity.
     The godless man makes plots 12 against the good, gnashing his teeth at them;
     but the Eternal laughs at him, 13 knowing his doom is near.
     The godless draw the sword, ia and bend their bows for murder;
     the sword runs into their own 15 heart,
     and their bows shall be broken!
     The little that a good man has 16 is better than a godless man’s great wealth;
     for the arms of the godless shall 17 be broken,
     but the Eternal will protect the good.
     The fortunes of the upright are 18 the Eternal’s care, and their possessions last for ever;
     in a calamity they keep their 19 share,
     in famine they have plenty.
     The godless perish,	20
     their families have to beg for 25 food;
     the foes of the Eternal disappear 20 like fuel,
     they disappear in smoke and vanish.
     si The godless never pays back what he borrows, but the good man is chari­table and gives.
         22 	Those who bless the Eternal,
     they shall own the land; those who curse him shall be uprooted.
         23 	When a man’s life pleases the
     Eternal,
     he gives him a sure footing;
         24 	he may fall, but he never falls
     down,
     for the Eternal holds him by the hand.
         25 	I have been young and I am old,
     but never have I seen good men forsaken;
         26 	they always have something to
     give away,
     something wherewith to bless their families.
         27 	Shun evil and do good,
     so shall you live your life within the land;
         28 	for the Eternal, who loves
     honesty,
     never forsakes his faithful band.
     The lawless shall be utterly destroyed,
     the families of the godless shall be doomed;
         29 	the land is the possession of the
     good,
     and all their days they shall dwell there.
         30 	The good man’s words are wise,
     his talk is true;
         31 	the Eternal’s law is in his heart,
     his footsteps never falter.
         32 	The godless man spies on the
     good,
     seeking to have them put to
     death;
     but the Eternal never leaves 33 them in his power, nor lets them be condemned when they are tried.
     Wait for the Eternal, hold to 34 him,
     and he will save you from the 40 godless;
     he will advance you to possess 34 the land,
     and to see godless men exter­minated.
     I saw a godless man once on a 35 time, a terror— towering like any cedar of Lebanon;
     then, as I passed by, he was 36 gone!
     I looked for him—he was not to be found.
     Hold to integrity, remain up- 37 right;
     there is a future for the peace­able.
     But sinners shall be wiped out at 38 a blow;
     the future for the godless is perdition.
     Help comes from the Eternal to 39 good men;
     he is their refuge in the evil hour:
     the Eternal relieves them and 40 rescues them,
     because they shelter beside him.
     A song of David. To be used when incense is offered.
     Punish me not in wrath, O90 1 thou Eternal,	OO
     do not chastise me in hot rage!
     Thine arrows have sunk deep in 2 me,
     thy hand is pressing hard on me.
         1 	There is no soundness in my
     body,
     thanks to thine indignation; there is no health in my limbs, thanks to my sins.
         2 	My iniquities are overwhelming
     me,
     crushing me like a heavy load;
         3 	my wounds are foul and fester­
     ing,
     thanks to my sinful folly.
         4 	I stagger about, bent to the
     ground,
     all day long I go a-mourning,
         5 	for my thighs are full of fever,
     there is no soundness in my body;
         6 	I am benumbed and badly
     bruised,
     my moans are louder than a lion’s cry.
         7 	Lord, all my longing is well
     known to thee, thou art no stranger to my sighs;
         8 	my heart is throbbing, the pith
     of life has left me, light has gone from mine eyes.
         9 	My friends and my companions
     hold aloof,
     my kinsmen keep away.
         10 	Those who seek my life are
     setting snares, aiming to injure me; they talk of ruining me, and all the day discuss in­trigues.
         11 	But, like one deaf, I never
     listen,
     like a dumb man, I never say a word.
         12 	[[I am like one who never hears,
     who has no argument in answer.]]
         13 	For thee, O thou Eternal, I am
     waiting;
     thou, thou wilt answer them, O Lord my God.
     For I confess my guilt,	18
         I 	sorrow for my sin.
     “Only,” I say, “let not my foes 16 exult over me,
     who are so insolent when I slip.”
     For I am on the verge of a 17 collapse;
     my plight is ever present to my mind.
     Many are they who hate me 19 wantonly,
     many are they who hate me wrongfully;
     they are returning evil for good, 20 they are my foes because I aim at good.
     Forsake me not, O thou Eternal, 21 be not far from me, O my
     God;
     make haste to help me,	22
     to rescue me, O Lord.
     From the Choirmaster Jedu- thun’s collection. A song of David.
         I 	said, I will be carefulQQ 1 what I do,	C3zf
     lest I sin with my tongue;
         I 	must put a muzzle on my lips in presence of the ungodly.
     So I kept silence,	2
     dumb and ill at ease.
     Yet this only stirred my grief; my heart grew hot within me, 3
     my thoughts kindled, and I prayed aloud:
     “Oh thou Eternal, let me know 4 my end,
     the number of my days, how long I have to live!
     Thou hast made my days no 5 longer than a span; my life is a mere nothing, in thy sight,
     no better than an empty breath.
     Man’s busy life indeed is but a 6 phantom,
     making an empty ado,
     amassing wealthand knowing not
     who is to have his hoard.
         1 	What then can I expect, O
     Lord?
     It is in thee I hope.
         1 	I am dumb, I never say a word, for it is thou who orderest life so.
     ix Thou chastenest mortal man, in punishing his guilt, eating away his comeliness like a moth—
     man is no better than an empty breath!
         1 	Save me from all my sins,
     from taunts of the profane; io relieve me from thy plague,
     for I am wasting underneath thy strokes.
         1 	Hear my prayer, O thou Eternal,
     listen to my cry, answer thou my tears; for I am but a guest of thine, a passing waif, as all my fathers were.
         2 	Avert thy frown, that I may be
     at ease,
     ere I depart to be no more.”
     From the Choirmaster s collec­tion. A song of David.
         1 	/I fk As patiently I waited for ^ the Eternal,
     he turned and listened to my cry;
         2 	he raised me from a lonesome
     pit, a muddy bog, he set my foot on a rock and steadied my steps,
         3 	putting a new song in my mouth,
     a song of praise to our God, that many might see this, and be awed,
     and trust in the Eternal. 16 17
     thy wondrous purposes for us;
     there is no one like thee!
     Were I to tell them, to recount them,
     they would pass all count.
     Thou carest not for sacrifice and 6 offering,
     for no burnt-offering or sin- offering is thy demand.
     An open ear thou gavest me;
     I answered, “Here I come 7
     to do thy bidding in the Book;
     to please and serve thee is my 8
     j°y»
     thy law lies deep within my heart.”
     Thou knowest, O Eternal One, 9 that openly
     I told the good news to our gathering;
     I kept not to myself thy saving 10 help,
     but told aloud thy loyalty and aid,

         O 	God, we have heard with^g A i our ears,
     our fathers have told us the tale,
     of thy doings in ancient years, how thou didst plant them, 2 evicting the pagans, how thou didst shatter the nations and scatter them.
     For the land was not won by 3 the sword of our fathers, nor the victory gained by their arm;
     thine was the hand and the arm, thine was the favour that smiled on them;
     my King, my God, it was thou 4 by whose command Jacob was conqueror!
     By thee we can thrust down 5 our foe,
     by thee we can crush our at­tackers;
     for I rely not on my bow,	6
     ’tis not my sword that wins the battle;
     from thee the victory comes to 7
     us,
     the humbling to our haters; all day it is of God we boast, 8 unceasingly we praise thee.
     And yet thou hast discarded us 9 in disgrace;
     thou wilt not march with our
     armies,
     thou makest us fly from the foe, io till our haters plunder us at pleasure;
     thou lettest us be eaten up like ii sheep,
     thou scatterest us among the
     pagans,
         2 	selling thy people cheap,
     for a poor price—no profit to thyself!
         3 	Thou makest us the butt of our
     neighbours,
     a scorn and a derision to all around,
         4 	a byword among pagans,
     jeered at by the nations;
         5 	all day long the disgrace is be­
     fore me,
     the shame of it overclouds me,
         6 	at the sound of the taunters
     and scoffers,
     at the sight of the vengeful foe.
         7 	All this has come upon us,
     yet never have we forgotten thee,
     never proved false to thy bond;
         8 	our heart has never flinched,
     our steps have never swerved from thine own road,
         9 	that thou should’st so crush us,
     and plunge us into deathly gloom,
     where jackals howl.
         10 	If we had forgotten the name
     of our God,
     or appealed to a foreign god,
         11 	would not God have found it
     out?

         12 	But no, ’tis for thy sake we are
     killed all day,
     counted no better than sheep to be slaughtered.
         13 	Bestir thyself, Eternal One!
     Why sleep?
     Awaken! ah, discard us not for ever!
         14 	Why art thou hiding thy face,
     forgetful of our woe and our distress?
         15 	For our soul is bowed to the
     dust,
     our body lies low on the ground.
     Come to the rescue!	26

     A noble theme inspires my a ff soul!
     Let me recite my verses to the king,
     with tongue swift as a scribe’s nimble pen.
     You are fairer than all mortals, 2 charm is playing on your lips, as you are ever blessed by God.
     O	hero, gird your sword upon 3 your thigh,
     array yourself in splendour and in state.
     Success to you, as you ride forth 4 to succour loyal men, humble and just!
     And may your courage lead to deeds of dread!
     Sharp are your arrows; nations 5 fall before you, and the king’s foes lose heart.
     Your throne shall stand for 6 evermore;
     for, since your sceptre is a sceptre just,
     since right you love and evil 7 you abhor,
     so God, your God, crowns you with bliss
     above your fellow-kings.
     Fragrant are your robes with 8 orris, myrrh, and aloes; music of ivory harps is rav­ishing your heart;
     kings’ daughters in their jewels 9 move to meet you, and on your right your queen wears gold of Ophir.
         1 	Listen, O bride, and bend your ear!
     Forget your own folk and your father’s house;
         2 	and when the king desires your
     beauty,
     yield to him—he is your lord.
         3 	So Tyrian traders with their
     gifts shall sue your fa­vour,

     Hear this, all ye nations, iQ x listen, all ye inhabitants vK' of the world,
     low-born and high,	2
     rich and poor, all of you.
     My message will be wise and 3 good,
     a baffling truth on which I
     brood;
     and as I catch its meaning dim, 4 I render on the lyre this hymn:
     Why should I be afraid in evil 5 times,
     when all around I behold treacherous foes,
     men who rely upon their riches, 6 and boast of their abounding wealth?
     Why, none can buy himself off; 7 not one can purchase for a price from God
     soul’s ransom is too dear	8
     life that shall never end. 9
     What! “Never die?” but die 10 they must—
     men of sense have to die, stupid and senseless perish, leaving their wealth to others; their home eternal is the grave 11 below,
     a dwelling where they must remain;
     they vanish from men’s mem­ory, although
     they claimed lands for their own.
         12 	For all the splendour that they
     cherish,
     men pass, even as the beasts that perish.
         13 	Such is the fate of the self-
     satisfied,
     the end of all whose faith is in themselves;
         14 	death shepherds them un­
     checked,
     driving them down to the world below;
     ere long their form and fashion waste away,
     and they abide within the world below.
         15 	(But God can ransom me;
     he will release me from the grasp of death.)
         16 	So fear not when a man grows
     rich,
     and when the splendour of his house increases;
         17 	he can take nothing with him
     when he dies,
     his splendour will not follow him below.
         18 	In life he flatters himself on his
     fortune,
     praising himself for his pros­perity;
         19 	but down he goes to where his
     fathers dwell,
     who see no light to all eternity.
         20 	For all the splendour that they
     cherish,
     men pass, even as the beasts that perish.

     1 Prt The Eternal speaks!-—from east to west earth falls a-trembling.
     From Sion, so peerless in 2 beauty,
     the God of gods is flashing!
     Our God comes with a sum- 3 mons—
     in front of him devouring fire, encircling him a mighty
     storm—
     calling high heaven and earth 4 to the trial of his people; the heavens announce his assize, 6 that God begins the trial.
     “Gather me my followers,	5
     who pledged their troth to me by sacrifice.
     Listen, O my people,	7
     let me speak, O Israel;
     I would testify against you,
     I who am God, your God.
     I blame you not for lack of 8 sacrifice;
     daily your offerings are set before me.
     I need no bullock from your 9 farms,
     no goat out of your herds; for all the wild things of the 10 wood are mine, and cattle in their thousands on the hills;
     every bird in the air I know, ix I own all roaming creatures on the plains.
     If I were hungry, I would not 12 tell you;
     for the whole earth is mine, and all it holds.
     Do I eat flesh of bulls?	13
     Do I drink blood of goats?
     No, offer to God thanks as your 14
     sacrifice,
     and pay your vows to the Most High;
     call to me in your hour of need, 15
     then I will rescue you, and you
     shall honour me.”
     God speaks thus to the godless: 16 “What right have you to repeat my laws,
     and take my compact on your lips,
         0 	when you hate me to control you,
     and toss my rules behind your backs?

         2 	you let your tongue loose for

     your mouths are weaving malice,
         3 	as you sit and malign your
     brother,
     slandering the son of your own mother.
         4 	This you have done—and be­
     cause I said nothing, you thought I was no better than yourself!
     But I will now convict you,
     I will put it to you plainly.
         5 	Mark this, you who ignore me,
     or I will tear you to pieces, with none to protect you:
         6 	whoever offers thanks to me as
     sacrifice, he honours me;
     whoever holds by my rules in his life,
     I will let him enjoy my help.”

     fill me with gladness and re- 8 joicing,
     that the life thou hast crushed may thrill with joy;
     hide thy face from my sins, 9 and wipe out all my guilt;
     make me a clean heart, O God, 10 and put a new, steadfast spirit in me;
     banish me not from thy pres- 11 ence,
     deprive me not of thy sacred Spirit;
     gladden me with thy saving aid 12 again,
     and give me a willing spirit as my strength,
     that I may teach offenders how 13 thou dealest,
     till sinful men turn back to thee.
     O	God my saviour, save me 14 from mortal sin; and my tongue shall praise thy faithfulness aloud.
     O thou Eternal, open thou my 15 lips,
     till my mouth makes thy praises known.
     Thou carest not for sacrifice,	16
     thou would’st not have burnt- offerings from me;
     God’s sacrifice is a soul with its 17 evil crushed:
     a heart broken with penitence,
         O 	God, never wilt thou de­spise.
     Grant happiness to Sion	18

     But lift me safe, O God,	29
     out of my pain and misery,
     and then I will sing praise to 30 God,
     and magnify him with thanks­giving;
         31 	’twill please the Eternal more
     than any bull,
     or any bullock that has horns and hoofs.
         32 	Mark all this and be glad, O
     folk forlorn,
     take heart, O worshippers of God;
         33 	the Eternal listens to a life in
     need,
     he never overlooks his own in prison.
         34 	Praise to him from heaven and
     earth,
     from seas and all that glide therein!
         35 	For God will succour Sion
     and rebuild the towns of Judah,
     till men dwell there and own them,
         36 	till his servants leave them to
     their children,
     and a race who love him live there.

     O God, make haste to me.
     Thou art my help and my de­liverer;
     tarry not, O Eternal.

     never let me be disappointed.
     Oh rescue me, save me, as thou 2 art faithful,
     turn thine ear to me and de­liver me.
     Be a stronghold, a fortress, for 3 me;
     help me, for thou art my crag and castle.
         O my God, rescue me from evil men,
     from cruel, unjust hands;
     for thou art my hope, O Lord, 5 I have trusted thee from youth,

     Through thee, my strength and 7 shelter,

     my lips shall be full of thy 8 praise,
     singing thy glory all day long.
     Cast me not off in my old age, 9 forsake me not when my powers fail;
     for murderous foes are plotting, 10 my enemies say of me,
     “Set on him, seize him, God ix has forsaken him, he has none to save him.”
     O God, be not far from me, 12 my God, make haste to help me.
     May all my enemies be dis- 13 graced, defeated, may insults and dishonour cover all who would injure me!
     As for me, I hope on and on, 14 I praise thee more than ever;
         15 	all day long I will be telling
     of thy victorious and faithful aid,
     though never can I tell it to the full;
         16 	I will recite the great deeds of
     the Lord,
     and praise thy faithful aid— and only thine.
         17 	Thou hast been teaching it from
     my youth, O God, and I have ever told thy wondrous deeds.
         18 	Forsake me not, O God,
     when I am old and grey; that I may tell the rising genera­tion
     of thy strength and thy might.
         19 	Thy faithful aid is high as
     heaven, O God, for great things thou hast done;
     who is like thee, O God?
         20 	Many a trial sore
     hast thou made us suffer, but thou wilt revive us once more
     and raise us from the depths;
         21 	thou wilt add to our honour,
     and comfort us once more.
         22 	So shall I praise thee on the lute
     for loyalty to me, my God, singing thy praises on the lyre, Majestic One of Israel.
         23 	My lips shall ring with joy and
     praise,
     even the life which thou hast saved;
         24 	all day long I will be talking
     of thy faithful aid, for those who fain would injure me
     are daunted and disgraced.

     An Asaphite song.
     1 ryo Yes, to the upright God is «O	good,
     to hearts unstained!
     ■2 I almost slipped,
     I nearly lost my footing,
         3 	in anger at the godless and their
     arrogance,
     at the sight of their success.
         4 	No pain is theirs,
     but sound, strong health;
     .5 no part have they in human cares,
     no blows like other men.
         1 	So they vaunt them in their
     pride,
     and flaunt them in rough in­solence;
         2 	vice oozes from their very soul,
     their minds are rank and riotous,
         3 	their talk is mocking and mali­
     cious.
     and haughtily they lay their plots;
     lofty as heaven itself their 9 speech,
     lording it over the world below.
     So people turn to follow them, 10 and see no wrong in them, thinking, “What does God care? 11 How can the Almighty heed— when these,
     the godless, prosperously fare, 12 thriving thus at their ease?” ’Tis all in vain I kept my heart 13 from stain, kept my life clean, when all day long blows fell on 14 me,
     and every dawn brought me some chastening!
     Yet, had I meant to utter this 15 aloud,
     I had been faithless to thy family.
     So I thought of it, thinking to 16 fathom it;
     but sorely did it trouble me, till I found out God’s secret, 17 viewing their latter end.
     Thou plantest them on slippery 18 ground,
     thou hurlest them to ruin— laid low in a single moment, 19 scared away, swept away, like a dream when one awakens, 20 like phantoms despised by the day!
     When my heart was sour, 21 when I felt sore,
     I was a dull, stupid creature, 22 no better than a brute before thee.
     Yet I am always beside thee; 23 thou holdest my right hand, guiding me with thy counsel, 24 leading me after thyself by the hand.
     Whom have I in heaven but 25 thee?
     On earth I care for nothing else.
         26 	Body and soul may fail,
     but God my strength is mine, my own for evermore.
         27 	Those who leave thee are lost;
     all who are faithless to thee, thou destroyest.
         28 	But to be near God is my bliss,
     to shelter with the Lord [[that I may tell of all thy works]].

         3 	Turn thy steps toward the
     standing ruins,
     to all the havoc of the foe within the sanctuary.
         4 	Thine enemies bawled inside
     thy house,
     set up their emblems there;
         5 	they smashed the doors down
     with their axes, like woodmen felling trees,
         6 	then broke up all the carved
     work there
     with hatchet and with hammer;
         7 	they set thy sanctuary ablaze, laying it low, profaning thine
     own dwelling.
         8 	They said to themselves, “Let
     us root them out!” so all the synagogues in the land they burned;
         9 	not an emblem of ours is to be
     seen.
     No prophet now—none knows when this will end!
         10 	O God, how long is the foe to be scoffing?
     Are the enemy always to blas­pheme thee?
     Why hold back thy hand, On God?
     Stretch out thy right hand and strike,
     thou who art our King of old, 12 gaining victories on earth!
     Thou didst divide the ocean by 13 thy power,
     shattering the Dragon’s heads upon the waves,
     crushing the heads of Levia- 14 than to pieces,
     leaving him a prey to jackals.
     Thou didst open springs and 15 torrents,
     thou didst dry up flowing
     streams;
     thine is the day and thine the 16 night,
     thou hast provided sun and starlight;
     thou hast arranged the earth in 17 its due order,
     thou hast made summer and winter.
     Thou to be scoffed at by foes, O 18 Eternal!
     Thou for an impious race to blaspheme!
     Leave not thy Dove Israel to a 19 brutal power;
     forget not thy poor people for all time.
     Look at these creatures, so sleek 20 and successful!— every corner is full of their vio­lence.
     Let not the downtrodden turn 21 from thee disappointed, but may the weak and wretched have good cause to praise thee!
     Up, O God, to vindicate the 22 cause that is thine own! Remember how the impious scoff at thee all day long; forget not the loud clamour of 23 thy foes,
     the endless din that rises from thine enemies.

     An Asaphite ode.
     Listen to my teaching, O «n 1 my people,	• ®
     give ear to what I say, as I open my lips in a poem 2 on deep lessons of the past, that we know as we have heard, 3 that our fathers told to us, hiding it not from their children, 4 but telling the next gener­ation
     the Eternal’s praise and power, the wonders he has done.
     He set up his witness in Jacob, 5 he appointed a law within Israel,
     bidding our fathers instruct their children,
     that the next generation 6 might understand, that children yet unborn might rise
     and tell their children after them,
     to put their confidence in God, 7 and not forget the deeds of God,
     but loyally obey him; that they might not be like their 8 fathers,
     a stubborn and unruly race, a wavering race— no loyal hearts for God.
     The Ephraimites were like a dis- 9 appointing bow, that fails upon the day of battle;
     they would not hold to their 10 compact with God, they would not follow his directions,
     they forgot what he had done, 11
     the wonders he had shown them.
         11 	Marvels he wrought, under
     their fathers’ eyes, in Egypt, in the land of Zoan;
         12 	he split the sea and led them
     through,
     piling the water up like walls,
         13 	he led them with a cloud by day,
     and all night with a blazing fire;
         14 	he split rocks in the wilderness,
     to give them a flow of drink in the desert,
         15 	he brought streams out of the
     rock,
     made water run like a river.
         16 	But still they sinned against
     him, in the desert they defied the Most High;
         17 	with a doubt of God in their
     mind,
     they demanded the food they craved,
         18 	they questioned God—was he
     able
     here in the desert to spread us a table?
         19 	He struck the rock till waters
     flowed
     and streams poured out; but can he give us food as well,
     and furnish flesh to his peo- ple?
         20 	When the Eternal heard this, he
     was wroth,
     he blazed out against Jacob, his wrath broke upon Israel,
         21 	for failing to believe in God,
     for trusting not his saving aid.
         22 	So, at his bidding, from the
     skies,
     as he opened the sluices of heaven,
         23 	manna rained down for their
     food,
     and he gave them heaven’s own grain;
         24 	men ate the bread of angels,
     he sent them food to the full.
     He brought an east wind over 26 the sky,
     he drove a strong wind from the south,
     raining flesh on them like the 27 dust,
     and birds like sand upon the beach,
     that dropped inside the camp, 28 close to their very tents.
     They ate, and they were gorged 29 then with
     the food they craved;
     and still they were at their sur- 30 feit,
     still eating up their food,
     when the anger of God broke on 31 them
     and slew their lusty men, laying the pick of Israel low.
     Yet on they went in sin;	32
     for all his wonders, they would not believe.
     So he made their days brief as 33 a breath,
     and the end of their life sud­den death.
     Then, if he slew them, they 34 sought after him, they would earnestly seek God again,
     remembering God was their 35 strength,
     and God Most High their preserver.
     But it was smooth words and no 36 more,
     their promises to him were false;
     they had a wavering mind, 37 they were not loyal to his compact.
     He in his great pity cancels sin, 38 dooms not to death;
     often he will avert his wrath,
     without one angry breath.
     So he remembered they were 39 mortal men,
     their life no better than a passing breeze;
         40 	though often they defied him in
     the desert,
     and vexed him in the wilder­ness,
         41 	with doubts of God again and
     again,
     that pained the Majestic One of Israel.
         42 	They remembered not his power,
     nor the day he saved them from the foe,
         43 	the portents that he wrought in
     Egypt,
     his marvels in the land of Zoan;
         44 	how he turned streams into
     blood,
     till none could drink the water,
     43 sent out swarms of dog-flies to devour,
     frogs to destroy,
         46 	let caterpillars have the crops,
     and locusts all the fruit of the foe’s labour;
         47 	he killed their vines with
     hail,
     the sycomores with frost,
         48 	gave cattle over to the plague,
     and beasts to the murrain.
         49 	His blazing anger he let loose,
     fury and rage and ruin, the messengers of woe;
         50 	straight and swift his anger
     sped, unsparing, letting the deadly pestilence prey on life;
         51 	he struck down all the first­
     born within Egypt, each oldest male child in the tents of Khem.
         52 	But his own people he led out
     like sheep,
     guiding them in the desert like a flock;
         53 	he led them safely on, past any
     fear,
     when the sea drowned their foes;
     he brought them to his sacred 54 soil,
     to hills he had won for him­self;
     he drove out nations before 55 them,
     and duly divided their land, for Israel’s clans to occupy.
     Yet they doubted and defied 56 the Most High God, they would not obey his rules;
     they fell back, false like their 57 fathers,
     they failed, like a disappoint­ing bow;
     their idols angered him upon the 58 heights,
     their images provoked his jealousy.
     God heard of it, and he was 59 furious—
     he was done with Israel!
     He abandoned his Dwelling at 60 Shilo,
     the tent he had pitched among men,
     he let his great ark be captured, 61 let his splendid ark fall to the foe;
     he abandoned his folk to the 62 edge of the sword, so furious was he with his own,
     till their youth fell in the 63 flames of war,
     and girls had never a wedding song,
     till their priests were cut to 64 pieces,
     and widows dared not raise a dirge.
     Then the Lord started up, as 65 from a sleep,
     and, like a hero wild with wine,
     he made rout of his foes,	66
     defeating and disgracing them for ever;
     and then, disowning the tents of 67 Joseph,


     passing by Ephraim’s clan,
         68 	he chose the clan of Judah,
     his beloved hill of Sion,

         1 	O God, the pagans have * Z7 invaded thy preserve,
     thy sacred shrine they have profaned,
     Jerusalem have they laid in ruins;
         2 	they have flung the corpses of
     thy servants
     to wild birds as their food, the flesh of thy followers to wild beasts;
         3 	all round Jerusalem
     their blood has been poured out like water,
     and there was none to give them burial. 40 41 42 43
     Help us, O God our saviour, 9 for the sake of thine own honour,
     and cancel thou our sins;
     rescue us, as thou art God, for why should pagans sneer, 10 “Where is their God?”
     Oh may we live to see thy vengeance fall on pagans, for spilling the blood of thy servants!
     Oh may the moan of prisoners 11 reach thee,
     and by thy mighty power release those who are doomed to die.
     Pay back our neighbours, Lord, 12 punish them seven times over for the taunts
     that they have heaped on thee.
     Then we thy people, the sheep 13 of thy pasture, will ever give thee thanks, and to all ages tell thy praise.

         I 	heard one whom I knew not, saying:
     “I freed your shoulder from the 6 load,
     your hands from the heavy hod;
     at your cry of distress I rescued 7 you,
     I answered you from thunder­clouds,
     I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
     Listen, my people, to my warn- 8 ing—
     O Israel, if you would only lis­ten:
     you must allow no foreign god, 9 no worship of an outside god;
     I am your God, I the Eternal, 10 who brought you out of Egypt’s land;
     open your mouth and I will fill it.
     But my people would not listen, 11 Israel would have none of me;
     so I left them to their own self- 12 will,
     to follow their own devices.
     Oh that my people would listen 13 to me,
     that Israel would live my life!
         1 	I would soon subdue their foes,
     and strike at their oppressors;

     for every follower of mine be­longs to her by birth.”
     The Eternal writes of every 6 nation, in his census,

     For trouble fills my soul to the 3 full,
     my life is on the verge of death;

     of whom thou hast mind no more—
     they are deprived of thee.

     Thine is a right powerful arm, 13 a strong hand, a right hand swung high;
     thy throne rests upon equity 14 and justice,
     Love and Faithfulness are thine attendants.

         16 	All day long they exult, O thou

         1 	Thou saidst, “I make a com­
     pact with my chosen,
         I 	swear to my servant David,
         1 	to make his dynasty endure,
     to make his throne last for all time”;
         15 	thou didst tell thy trusted seer,
     thy voice came in a vision:
     “I have crowned a hero, chosen a youth from the peo­ple,
         16 	I have picked out my servant
     David
     and consecrated him as king.
         17 	My hand shall always be a help
     to him,
     my arm shall make him strong;
         18 	no foe shall ever surprise him,
     no miscreant shall master him;
         19 	I will shatter his enemies before
     him,
     and strike down all who hate him;
         20 	my loyalty and love shall be
     with him,
     and I will lift him high in honour;
         21 	I will extend his power to the sea,
     and his authority far as the Euphrates;
         22 	he shall say, ‘Thou art my
     Father,
     my God, my saving strength!’ And I will make him my first- 27 born son,
     highest of all kings on earth.
     I will always keep my word to 28 him,
     my compact with him stands secure;
     I make his dynasty eternal, 29 his throne unending as the heavens.
     If his sons forsake my law, 30 and follow not my orders, if they violate my rules,	31
     and obey not my commands, then I will scourge them for 32 their sin
     and lash them for their law­lessness,
     but I will never take my love 33 from him,
     never will I belie my loyalty; my compact I will never violate, 34 my spoken word I will not change.
     Once and for all I took a solemn 35 oath,
     and I will keep my word to David,
     that for all time his dynasty 3d should last,
     his throne endure before me like the sun,
     fixed as the moon for evermore, 37 firm as the constant sky.”
     And yet thou hast scorned, dis- 38 carded,
     stormed against thy chosen!
     Thou hast abjured the compact 39 with thy servant, and thrown his sacred crown into the dust;
     thou hast demolished all his walls 4° and laid his forts in ruin; the passers-by aH plunder him, 41 and he is the butt of his neighbours.
     Thou hast allowed his enemies 42 to triumph,
     giving delight to all his foes;
         43 	thou hast made him retreat
     before them,
     and hast not upheld him in battle.
         44 	Thou hast removed his splendid
     sceptre
     and dashed his throne to the ground;
         45 	thou hast shortened the days of
     his youth
     and heaped disgrace on him.
         46 	How long, O thou Eternal, wilt
     thou hide away?
     Shall thy wrath, like a fire, burn on for ever?
         47 	Remember, Lord, what life is!—
     how frail and futile thou hast made all men!
         48 	Who can live on and die not,
     who can escape the grave?
         49 	Where is thy former love, O
     Lord,
     which thou didst pledge to David faithfully?
         50 	Remember, Lord, the taunts
     thrown at thy servants, the insults of the world we have to bear,

         4 	he protects you with his pinions and hides you underneath his
     wings.
         5 	You need not fear the terrors of
     the night,
     nor arrows flying in the day;
         6 	you need not fear plague stalk­
     ing in the dark, nor sudden death at noon;
         7 	hundreds may fall beside you, thousands at your right hand, but the plague will never reach
     you,
         1 	safe shielded by his faithfulness.
         1 	You have only to look on and
     see
     how evil men are punished;
         2 	but you have sheltered beside
     the Eternal,
     and made the Most High God your home,
         3 	so no scathe can befall you,
     no plague can approach your tent.
         4 	For he puts you under his
     angels’ charge,
     to guard you wherever you
     lest you trip over a stone;
         13 	you can walk over reptiles and
     cobras,
     trampling on lions and on drag­ons.
         14 	“He clings to me, so I deliver
     him;
         I 	set him safe, because he cares for me;
     I will answer his cry and be with 15 him in trouble,
     delivering him and honouring
     him;
     I will satisfy him with long life, 16 and let him see my saving care.”
     A song for the sabbath. To be
     accompanied.
     It is a joy to give thanks to nn 1 the Eternal,
     to sing thy praise, O thou Most High,
     to proclaim thy goodness in the 2 morning
     and thy faithfulness at night, to the sound of a ten-stringed 3 lute,
     to the sweet music of the lyre; thy doings have made me glad, 4 O thou Eternal,
     I sing for joy at all that thou hast done.
     How great thy deeds are, O Eternal,
     how deep are thy designs!
     The dull man does not see, 6
     the senseless does not under­stand,
     that when bad men thrive like 7 grass,
     and evildoers flourish,
     ’tis only to be rooted up for ever,
     while thou art supreme ever, 8 O Eternal.
     Yonder are thy foes, O thou 9 Eternal,
     yonder are thy foes, de­stroyed!—
     all evildoers scattered!
     But thou dost raise me high to 10 honour,
     thou dost revive my failing strength;
     I feast mine eyes on my defeated 11 foes,
     I hear with joy my enemies’ doom.
     But good men flourish like a 12 palm,
     and grow like ce'dars on Leb­anon;
         13 	planted inside the Eternal’s pre­
     cincts,
     they flourish in the courts of our God,
         14 	still bearing fruit when they
     are old,
     still fresh and green—
         15 	showing how just the Eternal is,
     my Strength who never errs.
     iQO The Eternal is reigning, -^'4 robed in majesty; the Eternal is robed with a girdle of power.
     Thou hast steadied and settled the world,
         O thy throne stands firm from of old,
     thou art from all eternity.
         1 	The floods may storm, O thou
     Eternal,
     the floods may storm aloud, the floods may storm and thunder;
         2 	but high above the roaring bil­
     lows,
     high above the ocean break­ers,
     the Eternal stands supreme.
         3 	Thine own authority will never
     fail,
     thy house will never lose its sanctity,
     O thou Eternal One. 44 45 46 47
     They crush thy people, O Eter- 5 nal,
     thy heritage they are harry- . ing,
     killing the widow and the for- 6 eigner
     and murdering the fatherless;
     and they think the Eternal 7 never sees them—
     Jacob’s God will never heed them!
     But mark this, dullest of the 8 dull—
     when will you understand, O senseless men?—
     is he deaf, he who made the 9 ear?
     Is he blind, he who formed the eye?
     Can he not punish men, he who 10 is training them?
     Has he no knowledge, he who teaches men?
     Knowledge! The Eternal knows n that human plans
     are but an empty breath!
     Happy is he who has thy dis- 12 cipline
     and thine instruction, train­ing him
     calmly to wait on, in adversity, 13
     till a pit is dug for the un­godly!
     For the Eternal will not leave 14 his people,
     never will he forsake his own;
     no, goodness shall have justice 15 done to it—
     the future is with men of up­right mind.
     Who is my champion against 16 the ungodly?
     Who sides with me against the evildoers?
     If the Eternal had not been my 17 help,
     I would have soon passed to the silent land.
         18 	When I think my foot is slip­
     ping.
     thy goodness, O Eternal, holds me up;
         19 	when doubts crowd into my
     mind,
     thy comforts cheer me.
         20 	Can evil rulers have thee for an
     ally,
     who work us injury by law,
         21 	who make an onset upon honest
     men,
     and doom the innocent to death?
         22 	No, the Eternal who is my pro­
     tection,
     my God who is my strength, my safety—
         23 	may he requite them for their
     crime,
     and for their evil make an end of them!
         1 	np Oh come let us sing to the
     O Eternal,
     let us sing loudly to our saving Strength,
         2 	let us come before him with
     thanksgiving,
     shouting to him songs of praise!
         3 	For a great God is the Eter­
     nal,
     the great King of all the gods;
         4 	the depths of earth he in his
     hand,
     the mountain-peaks are his,
         5 	he made the sea, he made the
     land,
     and sea and land are his.
         6 	Come, let us worship and how
     dowh,
     kneeling to him who made us;
         7 	the Eternal is our God, and we
     the people whom he shep­herds.

     ... if you would only listen to my voice to-day,
     and be not stubborn as at 8 Meribah,
     as once at Massa in the wilderness,
     when your forefathers doubted 9 me,
     and tested me, though they had felt my power.
     For forty years I loathed that 10 generation;
     I said, “They are a senseless people,
     who care not for my ways”;
     so I swore in solemn anger, 11
     they should never reach my rest.
     Sing a new song to the (\/Z 1 Eternal,
     sing, all the earth, to the Eternal,
     sing to the Eternal, praise him, 2
     day after day tell of his saving aid;
     let the heathen hear his glory, 3
     let every nation know his wondrous deeds.
     For great is the Eternal, loudly 4 to be praised,
     and to be feared above all gods;
     for all gods of the nations are 5 mere idols,
     but the Eternal made the heavens;
     grandeur and majesty attend 6 him,
     splendour and power are in his sanctuary.
     Praise the Eternal, O families of 7 the nations,
     praise the Eternal for his glory and his might!
     praise the Eternal for his own 8 open glory,

         1 	The Eternal reigns! Let • earth rejoice,
     let many a shore be glad.
         2 	His throne rests upon equity
     and justice;
     clouds and darkness surround him,

     rejoice, ye just, in the Eternal, 12 give thanks as you recall his sacred name.
     A song.
     Oh sing a new song to the aq i Eternal,	ZrO
     for marvels he has done, his right hand has won victory by his majestic power; the Eternal has let the nations see 2 his triumph and his victory.
     He has remembered to be kind 3 to Jacob
     and loyal to the house of Israel;
     from end to end the world has
     seen
     the victory of our God.
     Shout praise, all earth, to the 4 Eternal,
     break into music and song, praise the Eternal with the lyre, 5 with lyre and song, shout praise before the King, 6 the Eternal,
     with bugle and with cornet.
     Let the sea and all within it 7 thunder praise, the world and its inhabitants, let rivers clap their hands, 8 let mountains sing in chorus before the Eternal—for he comes 9 to rule the world, to rule the world with justice, nations with equity.
     The Eternal is king! Let QQ 1 the nations shake! ZsZs He is enthroned! Let the world quake!

         2 	Thou art a King, in love with

     thou hast restored equity, thou maintainest right and justice.
         3 	Exalt the Eternal One, our God,
     and worship at his footstool; a mighty Majesty is he.
         4 	His priests have still a Moses
     and an Aaron,
     his worshippers have still a Samuel;
     and the Eternal answers when they call to him,
         5 	still through a cloudy pillar
     speaks to them, when they keep the com­mands he has laid down.
     ? O Eternal, our God, thou answerest them; thou hast been a forgiving God to them,
     and hast avenged their wrongs.
         6 	Exalt the Eternal One, our God, and worship at his sacred hill: for the Eternal is a mighty Majesty.
     A song for the thank-offering service.

     A song of David.
     I will be kind and just 1 ai X before thee, O Eter- nai;
     let a just man’s case come up, 2 and I will deal with it.
     I will five uprightly in my own house,
     I will have no base aims.	3
     Apostates and their practices I hate;
     they appeal not to me.
     I banish purposes perverse, 4
     I disown evil men.
     If a man slander secretly his 5 fellow,
     I silence him;
     if any man is proud and haughty,
     I will not suffer him.
     I look out for the faithful in the 6 land,
     to have them at my court;
     men of integrity shall be my ministers;
     deceitful men shall not dwell in 7 my household,
     no man who tells a lie has a po­sition with me.
     I will be active to wipe out all 8 wicked natives from the land,
     to root out every evildoer from the Eternal’s city.
     The prayer of an unhappy soul who is overwhelmed and pours out his plaint before the Eter­nal.
     Listen to my prayer, O "l aa i thou Eternal,
     let my cry for help reach thee;
     hide not thy face from me 2 on my day of trouble,
     bend thine ear to me, answer me quickly when I call.
         3 	My days are vanishing like
     smoke;
     my limbs are fevered like a fire,
         4 	my health is blighted, withering
     like grass—
     I forget to take my food;
         5 	my skin is stretched tight on the
     bone,
     so bitterly I moan.
         6 	I am like a pelican in the des­
     ert,
     like an owl moping in the ruins;
         7 	I cannot sleep, I mourn
     like a lonely bird on the roof;
         8 	all day long my foes are taunting
     me,
     those who mock me call me “The accursed.”
         9 	I eat ashes with my food,
     tears fall into my drink,
         10 	so angry and so furious art thou
     —thou who didst lift me and hast thrown me down!
         11 	My days are brief as any eve­
     ning shadow,
     and I am withering away like grass.
         23 	He has broken my strength,
         24 	he has shortened my days, till
         I 	cry;
     “My God, remove me not before my days are done,
     O thou whose years endure age after age!”
     * * *
         3 	O thou Eternal, throned for ever,
     from age to age thy fame en­dures;
         4 	thou wilt rise to have pity on
     Sion—
     ’tis time, ’tis time to favour her;
     her scattered stones are dear to 14 thy servants,
     and they are distressed at the dust of her ruins.
     When the Eternal builds up 16 Sion,
     appearing in his majesty, when he turns to the forlorn, 17 despising not their prayer, then pagans will revere thee,	15
     all kings on earth will own thy majesty.
     When the Eternal bends from 19 his sacred height, and looks from heaven to earth,
     to hear the prisoner’s groan, 20 and to release the doomed; let this be set down for future 18 generations,
     that people yet unborn may praise the Eternal, rehearsing his fame in Sion 21 and praising him at Jerusa­lem,
     when realms and nations gather 22 there
     to worship the Eternal.
     Thou didst found the earth of 23 old,
     the heavens are the work of thy hands;
     they vanish, but thou shalt 26 endure,
     they wear out like a robe; thou changest them like gar­ments, and they change, but thou art still the same, 27 O thou Eternal, thy years shall never end; and in thy presence live thy serv- 28 ants’ children,
     and their posterity perpet­ually.
     A song of David.
     Bless the Eternal, O "| r|*> 1 my soul,	XvK>
     let all my being bless his sacred name;
         2 	bless the Eternal, O my soul,
     remember all his benefits;
         3 	he pardons all your sins,
     and all your sicknesses he heals,
         4 	he saves your life from death,
     he crowns you with his love and pity,
     3 he gives you all your heart’s desire,
     renewing your youth like an eagle’s.
         6 	The Eternal vindicates the
     cause
     of any who are wronged;
         7 	he let Moses see this purpose,
     and Israel his methods.
         8 	The Eternal is pitiful and gra­
     cious,
     slow to be angry, rich in love;
         9 	he will not always chafe,
     he will not hold to his anger for all time;
         10 	he treats us not according to our
     sins,
     he deals not with us as our guilt deserves;
         11 	but, high as heaven is over
     earth,
     so vast his love is to his wor­shippers;
     is as far as east from the west, so far he puts our sins away from us.
         13 	As a father pities his children,
     so the Eternal pities his wor­shippers;
         14 	he knows what we are made
     of,
     he remembers we are dust.
         15 	Poor man!—his days are like the
     grass,
     he blooms like a flower in the meadow;
         16 	at the breath of a breeze it is
     gone,
     and its place never sees it again.
     But the Eternal’s love is ever- 17 lasting,
     his loyalty goes on to chil­dren’s children,
     when they obey his compact 18 and remember to do his bid­ding.
     In heaven has the Eternal fixed 19 his throne,
     and his dominion covers all the world.
     Bless the Eternal, O his angels, 20 ye strong spirits who obey his word!
     Bless the Eternal, all his hosts, 21 ye servants who carry out his will!
     Bless the Eternal, all his works 22 in every sphere of his do­minion!
     Bless the Eternal, O "l 1 my soul!
     Eternal One, my God, thou art most great, arrayed in glorious majesty.
     Thou wrappest thyself in a robe 2 of light,
     thou spreadest the sky like a tent,
     thou buildest thy chambers 3 on the waters above;
     thou makest clouds thy chariot, thou ridest on the wings of the wind;
     thou makest winds thy messen- 4 gers,
     fire and flame thy servants.
     Thou didst found the earth upon 5 its pillars, never to be shaken,
     drawing the deep over it,	6
     till the waters rose over the mountains;
     but they retired at thy rebuke, 7 scared at the sound of thy thunder,
     never to pass thine appointed 9 bounds,
     or cover earth again;
         8 	the mountains rose, the valleys sank,
     to the place thou madest for them.
         10 	He pours the streams into the
     valleys,
     that flow between the moun­tains,
         11 	where all the wild beasts drink,
     wild asses quench their thirst;
         12 	there the wild birds settle,
     singing among the branches,
         16 	as the great trees drink their
     fill,
     the cedars the Eternal sowed on Lebanon,
         17 	where birds build their nests,
     the stork with her home in the cypress.
         18 	The high hills shelter the wild
     goat,
     the marmot hides in the rocks.
         10 	He waters the hills from his
     high chambers, and rains abundantly upon the land,
         11 	till grass grows for the cattle,
     and fodder for the beasts that serve mankind;
     that he may bring food from the earth,
         12 	wine to cheer up the heart of
     man,
     oil, that his skin may shine, bread to sustain his strength.
         16 	He marks the seasons by the
     moon,
     he tells the sun when it must set.
     30 Thou makest it dark; night falls, and every wild beast in the wood is moving—
         21 	lions roaring for their prey
     and claiming food from God;
         22 	when the sun rises, then they
     slink away
     to lie down in their lairs,
     but man comes out to work, 23 and labours till the evening.
     How manifold thy works, Eter- 24 nal One,
     all of them wisely made!
     Yonder the sea lies, vast and 25 broad,
     with its countless swarms, with creatures small and great,
     with fleets of the nautilus, 26 with leviathan at his play!
     The world is full of thy crea- 24 tures, all looking to thee 27 for their food in season due;
     what thou givest, that they 28 gather,
     feasting from thine open hand.
     But when thy face is hidden, 29 they are scared, when thou recallest their breath, they die.
     Yet a breath from thee brings 30 them into being, renewing the face of the earth.
     For ever may the glorious might 31 of the Eternal last!
     May the Eternal joy in his own works!
     Earth trembles at a glance from 32 him,
     the mountains smoke at his touch.
     Long as I live, I will sing to the 33 Eternal,
     and praise my God while I have breath.
     May these my thoughts please 34 him—
     I find my joy in the Eternal!
     May sinners be swept out of the 35 world,
     may evil men no longer live in it!
     Bless the Eternal, O my soul! Hallelujah!

         4 	the compact made with Abra­
     ham,
     the oath he swore to Isaac, io confirming it as a decree to Jacob,
     for Israel as a lasting com­pact,

     to hold it as their own pos­session.
         6 	Few in number were our fathers,

         7 	wandering from one nation to
     another,
     and from realm to realm;
         8 	but he would not let a man
     oppress them,
     he would punish kings on their account,
         9 	saying, “Never touch my cho­
     sen,
     never harm my prophets.”
     He called a famine on the land, 16 destroying all the Egyptians’ sustenance.
     He sent a man in front of them, 17 Joseph, sold as a slave; his feet were forced into fetters, 18 he was laid in irons, till the promise of the Eternal 19 came true,
     the promise that tested him.
     Then the king sent and released 20 him,
     the monarch set him free, and made him master of his pal- 21 ace,
     lord of all that he possessed, to control his nobles as he 22 pleased,
     and dictate to his councillors.
     Then Israel entered Egypt, 23 Jacob lived in the land of Khem.
     God multiplied his people 24 . greatly,
     till they outnumbered the Egyptians,
     who turned to hate his people, 25 to handle his servants craftily.
     So he sent his servant Moses, 26 and Aaron whom he chose; he wrought portents within £7 Egypt,,
     marvels in the land of Khem; darkness he sent, he made it 28 dark,
     but they would not heed his word;
     he turned their waters into 29 blood,
     and killed their fish; frogs swarmed over their 30 country,
     into the very chambers of the king;
     dog-flies swarmed at his com- 31 mand,
     and lice through all their lahd;
     he gave them hail for rain, 32 as fire flashed over the land,
         33 	striking their vines and fig-
     trees,
     breaking the trees of the coun­try;
         34 	at his bidding locusts came,
     and grasshoppers past count­ing,
         35 	that ate up all the green growth
     of the land,
     and every crop;
         36 	he struck down all the first­
     born in their land, each oldest male child.
         37 	Then he led out his clansmen,
     carrying spoil of gold and silver,
     not a weary man among them;
         38 	glad was Egypt when they
     left,
     for they were dreaded.
         39 	He spread out clouds to shelter
     them,
     and lit them in the night with fire;
         40 	he sent them quails, at their
     demand,
     and bread of heaven in plenty;
         41 	he opened rocks, and through
     the sand
     water rushed like a river.
         42 	Eor he remembered his own
     sacred pledge to Abraham his servant.
         43 	So he brought his people out
     with joy,
     his chosen with a song and shout;
         44 	he gave them the lands of the
     nations,
     and they possessed the fruit of others’ toils.
         45 	’Twas all that they should carry
     out his orders and obey his laws. 51
     Who can proclaim the Eternal’s 2 mighty deeds,
     or do full justice to his praise?
     Happy are they who hold to 3 what is right,
     who do their duty at all times!
     They share the welfare of thy 5 chosen band,
     thy nation’s joy, the triumph of thy land.
     Remember us in thy goodwill, 4 Eternal,
     oh save and prosper thine own people.
     For, like our fathers, we have 6 sinned,
     we have done evil, have done wickedly.
     At the Reed Sea our fathers 7 defied the Most High,
     heedless of his wonders done in Egypt,
     forgetting all the kindness he had shown them.
     Yet he saved them for his own 8 sake,
     to display his power;
     the Reed Sea dried up at his 9 bidding,
     through the deep he led them like a desert,
     saving them from hostile hands, 10
     rescuing them from the foe;
     the waters rose over their ene- 11 mies,
     till not a man was left.
     Then they believed his promise, 12
     and they sang his praise.
     But soon they forgot what he 13 had done,
     they would not be patient with his purposes;
     they had a craving in the wil- 14 derness,
     that made them doubt God in the desert;
         15 	he let them have what they
     desired,
     then—made them loathe it!
         16 	When they were jealous of
     Moses in the camp, and of Aaron, whom the Eter­nal consecrated,
         18 	fire broke out in their company,
     and flames burned up the wicked;
         15 	earth opened to swallow Dathan
     up,
     and closed over Abiram’s crew.
         18 	At Horeb they made a calf,
     and worshipped a metal image,
         19 	bartering God their glory
     for the image of an ox that munches grass!
         20 	They forgot God their deliverer,
     who had done great deeds in Egypt,
         21 	marvels in the land of Khem,
     deeds of awe at the Reed Sea.
         22 	So he threatened to destroy
     them,
     had not Moses stepped into the breach,
     had not Moses, whom he had chosen, faced him, to avert his deadly wrath.
         23 	And then they scorned the land
     of delight;
     they would not believe what he promised,
         24 	but grumbled in their tents
     and would not listen to his word;
         25 	so he swore solemnly
     to lay them low in the desert,
         26 	to scatter their children among
     heathen men,
     and disperse them over the world.
         27 	When they joined the Baal of
     Peor,
     and ate food offered to the dead,
     they angered him with their 29 misdeeds,
     and plague broke out among them.
     But Phinehas rose to interpose, 3<> and so the plague Was checked—
     which was counted in his favour, 31 as a merit for all time.
     At the waters of Meribah they 32 enraged God,
     rebelling against his Spirit, 33 till they made Moses go wrong 32 and utter words in haste. 33
     Nor did they root out the pa- 34 gans,
     as the Eternal ordered; they mixed with heathen men 35 and learned their ways, and worshipping their idols were 36 ensnared;
     they sacrificed to demons, 37 sacrificed their sons and daughters,
     pouring out innocent blood, 38 till the land was stained with murder.
     They were befouled by what 39 they did,
     and broke faith by their practices.
     So the Eternal’s anger blazed 40 against his people, he loathed his heritage; he abandoned them to pagans, 41 to be ruled by those who hated them;
     their foes oppressed them, 42 forced them to submission. Many a time he rescued them; 43 but they would take their own rebellious way,
     till evildoing wasted them away.
     Yet he regarded their distress, 44 when he heard them wailing; he remembered for their sake his 45 compact,
     in his great goodness he re­lented;
         33 	he made their very captors
     have compassion upon them.
         34 	O thou Eternal, our God, save
     us,
     gather us out of the na­tions,
     that we may give thanks to thy sacred name,
     and triumph in thy deeds of praise.
         35 	Blessed be the Eternal, Israel’s
     God, from age to age, for ever!
     Let all the people add “Amen.”

     Some lay in darkness and in 10 gloom,
     prisoners in chains and mis­ery,
     because they had rebelled at 11 God’s commands and scorned what the Most High enjoined;
     hard labour crushed their spirit, 12 and wearied out, forlorn,
     they cried to the Eternal in their 13 need,
     to save them from their evil plight;
     he took them from the darkness 14 and the gloom, he snapped their chains.
     Let them thank the Eternal for 15 his kindness,
     and for the wonders that he does for men;
     he breaks the gates of bronze, 16 and shatters iron bars.
     Some, weakened by their sinful 17 ways,
     were sick and suffering through evildoing;
     they had a loathing for all 18 food,
     were on the verge of death;
     they cried to the Eternal in their 19 need,
     to save them from their evil plight;
     he sent his word to heal them 20 and preserve their life.
     Let them thank the Eternal for 21 his kindness,
     and for the wonders that he does for men;
     let them offer the sacrifice of 22 thanksgiving,
     and joyfully recount what he has done.
     Some crossed the sea in ships, 23 trading in great waters;
     they saw what the Eternal 24 does,
     his marvels in the deep.
         23 	When the gale rose at his bid­
     ding,
     and the waves tossed with the storm,
         24 	they soared to heaven, sank to
     the depth,
     their courage melting;
         25 	they reeled and staggered like a
     drunken man,
     and were at their wit’s end.
         26 	They cried to the Eternal in
     their need,
     to save them from their evil plight;
         27 	he stilled the storm to a whisper,
     till the waves were hushed—
         28 	glad were they for the calm—
     and then he brought them to their longed-for haven.
         29 	Let them thank the Eternal for
     his kindness,
     and for the wonders that he does for men;
         30 	let them extol him, when the
     people meet,
     and praise him in the council of the sheikhs.
         31 	He turns streams into a desert,
     and fountains into dry land;
         32 	he turns an oasis into a salt
     waste,
     to punish people for their sins.
         33 	He turns a desert into pools of
     water,
     and dry land into fountains,
         34 	where he settles famished folk,
     to build a town for habitation,
         35 	sowing fields and planting vine­
     yards,
     gathering in their harvest;
         36 	by his blessing they increase,
     and their herds never dimin­ish.
     40 He pours contempt on lords, and sets them in a pathless waste astray,
         37 	till they grow few and faint
     under the weight of misery;
     but he lifts poor men from their 41
     woes,
     and makes their household like a fruitful flock.
     Good men rejoice to see this, 42 wrongdoers are silenced.
     Let any wise man ponder it, 43 and lay to heart how kind the Eternal is.

     Up, O God, high over heaven! 5 Up with thy glory over all the earth!
     To the rescue of thy dear folk! 6 Save by thy right hand, answer our entreaty.
     God gave his sacred promise:	7
     “I will divide up Shechem in triumph,
     and parcel out the vale of Sukkoth;
     Gilead is mine, Manasseh mine, 8 Ephraim I take for helmet, Judah for my baton—
     Moab I make a wash-basin, 9 Edom I claim as subject, and over Philistia I will triumph.”
     Ah, who will lead us inside the 10 hill-fort?
     Who will take us conquering into Edom?
     Hast thou not discarded us, n shamed us, O God? thou would’st not march out with our army.

     Never did he remember to be 16 kind;
     but wretched, weak, and broken-hearted creatures
     he persecuted to the death.
     He would not bless?—blessings 17 be far from him!
     He loved to curse?—may curses light on him!

         4 	“You are to be a priest for
     life”—
     so swears the Eternal, his oath will not change—
     “a priest as once Melkizedek was.”
         5 	The Lord is at your side,
     shattering kings upon his day of wrath.
         6 	My lord sends pagans to their

     He feeds his worshippers;	5
     never does he forget his com­pact.
     He has shown his people his 6 power in action, as he gave them the homes of the heathen.
     Faithfully he deals and justly, 7 trustworthy are all his pre­cepts;
     his orders are enacted for all 8 time,
     issued in faithfulness and justice;
     he has sent his people freedom, 9 fixing his compact with them for all time— a God majestic, terrible.
     The first thing in knowledge is 10 reverence for the Eternal: it is sound sense for everyone. His praise endures for ever.

     Why should pagans sneer, 2 “Where is that God of theirs?”
     Ah, he is in heaven, our God, 3 he does whate’er he pleases.

     with eyes—but they cannot see,
     with ears—but they cannot hear, 6 with noses—but they cannot smell,
     with hands—but they cannot 7 feel,
     with feet—but they cannot walk!
     No sound from them!
     No breath of life is in them!

     Thou hast saved my life from 8 death,

     Though I cried out, “I am 10 crushed,”
     thinking, in my distraction, 11 “All men are a failure,” yet I had faith.
     Now, what can I render to the 12 Eternal
     for all his benefits to me?
     I will offer a libation for my 13 rescue,
     and proclaim the Eternal aloud;
     I will pay what I vowed to the 14 Eternal,

     Precious in the eyes of the 15 Eternal
     is the death of his devoted.
     Eternal One, I am indeed thy 16 servant,
     thy servant, thy retainer; thou hast delivered me.
     I will offer thee the sacrifice of 17 thanksgiving,

     laud him, all ye races;
     for his kind love to us is vast, 3 his loyalty will ever last.
         1 	| in Hallelujah.
     A AO Give thanks to the Eter­nal!—he is good, his kindness never fails.
         2 	Let Israel repeat,
     “His kindness never fails”;
         3 	let Aaron’s household repeat,
     “His kindness never fails”;
         4 	let the Eternal’s worshippers re­
     peat,
     “His kindness never fails.”
         5 	I was hard pressed, I called to
     the Eternal;
     the Eternal answered, and he set me free.
         6 	The Eternal is upon my side; I
     have no fear.
     What can man do to me?
         7 	I have the Eternal as my
     Helper;
     so I shall feast mine eyes on my defeated foes.
         8 	Far better to rely on the Eternal
     than put faith in men;
         9 	far better to rely on the Eter­
     nal than put faith in princes.
         10 	The pagans were all swarming
     round me;
     I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
         11 	Swarming round me, they beset
     me;
     I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
     13 They swarmed like bees about me;
     I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
     They blazed like the fire among thorns;
     I routed them, relying on the Eternal.
         13 	Hard pressed was I, about to
     fall,
     but the Eternal helped me.
         14 	The Eternal is my strength, of
     him I sing,
     he has delivered me indeed.
         15 	Hark,the joyful shout of triumph
     in the tents of the just!—
     “The Eternal’s right hand car­ries the day,”
     “The Eternal’s right hand tri- 16 umphs,”
     “The Eternal’s right hand car­ries the day!”
     I shall not die, but live	17
     to proclaim the Eternal’s deeds;
     The Eternal has been chastening 18 me sorely,
     but he has not left me to die.
     Open to me the gates of Vic- 19 tory,
     that I may enter in to thank the Eternal.
     “Here is the Eternal’s gate; 20
     the just alone can enter.”
     Thanks unto thee for answering 21 me,
     for thy deliverance.
     The stone the builders cast 22 aside
     is now the building’s strength and pride;
     this is the doing of the Eternal— 23
     we can but watch and won­der.
     “This is a day we owe to the 24 Eternal;
     let us be glad and rejoice in it.
     O thou Eternal, lend thine aid! 25
     O thou Eternal, prosper us!
     In the Eternal’s name, blessed 26 be he who enters!”
     “We bless you from the house of the Eternal,
     our God, the Eternal, who has 27 brought us light.”
     Round and round the altar
     dance,
     waving your boughs, linked together,
     singing, “Thou art my God, I 28 praise thee,
     thou art my God, I extol thee.”
     Give thanks to the Eternal!— 29 he is good,
     his kindness never fails.
         1 	1 IQ Happy are they who live
     uprightly, living by the Eternal’s law!
         2 	Happy are they who follow
     his injunctions, giving him undivided hearts,
         3 	who do no wrong, who keep
     to his paths!
         4 	Thou hast laid down thy be­
     hests for us to do them dili­gently;
         5 	oh that my life were set on
     thine obedience!
         6 	No shame befalls me when I
     heed thy commands.
         7 	As I learn the justice of thy rul­
     ings, I thank thee with un­feigned heart;
         8 	I will obey thee: never do
     thou forsake me.
         9 	How can a young man keep life
     clean? By keeping to thy word.
     io	I give thee an undivided heart; oh never may I stray from thy control!
     xi I store thy word within my heart, to keep myself from sinning against thee.
         1 	Blessed be thou, O Eternal;
     teach me thy will.
         2 	My lips recount all that thy
     lips enjoin;
         3 	I find more joy in thine in­
     junctions than in any wealth.
         4 	I muse on thy behests and mark
     thy paths;
         5 	in thy will I delight, I never
     will forget thy word.
         6 	Deal kindly with thy servant,
     till I five to do thy bid­ding;
         7 	open mine eyes to see the
     wonders of thy law;
         8 	hide not thy commands from
     me, an alien on the earth.
         9 	My soul yearns all the time for
     thee to intervene,
     to check the arrogant, to curse 21 all who swerve from thy control;
     relieve me from their insults 22 and contempt, for I follow thine injunctions.
     Nobles may plan to attack me, 23 but thy servant muses on thine orders;
     my advisers are thine own 24 injunctions—I delight in them.
     My soul is bowed to the dust: 25 revive me, even as thou hast promised;
     teach me thine orders, thou 26 who answerest me when I tell thee of my plight; show me how thy will works, 27 that I may muse upon thy wondrous deeds.
     My sou! is melting under 28 trouble: nerve me, as thou hast promised;
     keep me from being false to 29 tfiee, and graciously direct me.
     A faithful life is what I choose, 30 thy demands are my desire;
         O 	thou Eternal, disappoint me 31 not, I bind me to thy bid­ding;
         1 	will obey thee eagerly, as 32 thou dost open up my life.
     Teach me, Eternal, how thine 33 orders run, and I will follow them step by step; instruct me how to carry out 34 thy law, and with my whole heart I will keep it; lead me along in thine obedi- 35 ence, for this is my joy.
     Incline my heart to thy behests, 36 and to no love of gain, make me alive to follow thee, 37 and turn mine eyes from cravings vain.
     Fulfil thy promise to thy serv- 38 ant, to advance thy faith;
         39 	remove the insults that I
     dread, and intervene for good;
         40 	as thou art true, revive me; I
     am yearning for thy will.
         41 	Let thy love come to my rescue,
     even as thou hast promised;
         42 	then I can face my revilers,
     relying on thy promise;
         43 	leave me not speechless for
     the truth:	my hope is,
     thou wilt intervene.
         44 	I would obey thy law contin­
     ually, always and evermore;
         45 	let me live unhampered, for I
     study thy behests.
         46 	I bear testimony to thy law
     before kings, unashamed;
         47 	I take delight in thy com­
     mands, so dear to me,
         48 	I adore thy commands and
     muse upon thine orders.
         49 	Remember thy promise to thy
     servant, for thou didst bid me hope;
         50 	this comforts me in trouble,
     thy promise puts life into me.
         51 	Arrogant men may deride me,
     but from thy law I never swerve;
         52 	I console myself, remembering
     thy judgments of old.
         53 	Hot indignation seizes me at
     the ungodly who forsake thy law.
         54 	Thy statutes are my songs, as I
     wander through the world.
         55 	I remember thy name by
     night and I obey thy law;
         56 	this is my blessed lot, to carry
     out thy behests.
         57 	Yes, O Eternal, to obey thy bid­
     ding, this is my lot;
         58 	with all my heart I pray thee
     to revive me, as thou hast promised.
         59 	Thinking on how to live, I turn
     to thy directions,
     I hasten instantly to follow 60 thy commands;
     evil men may ensnare me, 61 but I never forget thy law.
     At midnight I rise to praise thee 62 for thy just interventions;
     I keep company with all thy 63 worshippers who carry out thy will;
     teach me thine orders, for the 64 world is full of thy good­ness.
     Thou hast been good to thy serv- 65 ant, as thou didst promise;
     train me in judgment and 66 knowledge, for I believe in
     thy commands;
     before my trouble I went 67 wrong, but now I do thy bidding.
     Thou art good and doest good, 68 teach me thine orders;
     proud men bespatter me with 69 lies, but I carry out thy behests;
     their minds are gross and dull, 70 but I thrill to thy law.
     It is good for me to have been in 71 trouble—-to learn thy will;
     thy law means more to me 72 than piles of gold and silver.
     Thy hands made and moulded 73 me, to understand thine orders;
     may thy worshippers rejoice 74 to see me waiting on thy word!
     Just are thy dealings, I know-— 75 thou wert faithful in afflict­ing me;
     but now console me with thy 76 love, as thou hast promised thy servant;
     let thy compassion bring me 77 life, for my delight is in thy law.
     Confound the arrogant who ill- 78 treat me, as I muse on thy behests;
         79 	let thy worshippers learn how
     thou rulest, by turning to
     my case;
         80 	let my obedience to thee be
     perfect, that I may not be disgraced.
         81 	My soul pines for thy saving aid,
         I 	am waiting for thy promise;
         79 	I pine with looking for thy
     promises; when wilt thou comfort me?
         80 	Though shrivelled like a wine­
     skin in the smoke, I never forget thine orders.
         81 	How few are thy servant’s days?
     When wilt thou doom my persecutors?
         82 	Insolent creatures, reckless of
     thy law, they dig pitfalls for me;
         83 	help me against their wanton
     wiles, O faithful lawgiver!
         84 	They nearly made an end of me,
     but I would not give up thy laws;
         85 	as thou art loving, revive me,
     and I will do thy bidding.
         86 	O thou Eternal, evermore thy
     law stands fast in heaven,
         87 	thy faithful promise holds
     from age to age, sure upon earth;
         88 	thy rule and order last to-day,
     for all things are thy serv­ants.
         89 	Unless thy law had been my
     comfort, I would have died in my misery;
         90 	never shall I forget thy laws,
     for they put new life into me.
         91 	Help me, for I am thine, I
     study thy behests;
         92 	the ungodly lie in wait to kill
     me, but I pay close heed to thine orders.
         93 	I see a limit to all things, but
     thy law has a boundless range.
     Oh how I love thy law! I 97
     muse upon it all day long;
     thy commands make me 98 wiser than my foes; I am never without them.
     I have more insight than all 99 these oracles, for I muse on thine injunctions!
     I know more than these 10c sages, for I carry out thy behests!
     I avoid all evil courses, that I ioi may do thy bidding;
     thou art my teacher, never 102 can I swerve from thine in­structions.
     How sweet thy sayings are, 103 sweeter than honey to the taste!
     I learn sense from thy be- 104 bests, learn to hate god­less ways.
     Thy law is a lamp for my feet, a 105 light on my path;
     I swore to follow thy just 106 decrees, and I will do it;
     revive me as thou hast prom- 107 ised, O Eternal, in my great misery.
     Accept the vows I breathe to 108 thee, and teach me thy decrees;
     my life is ever in danger, but 109 I never forget thy law;
     ungodly men set snares for no me, but I never give up thine orders.
     I have a lasting heritage in thy in commands, they are my heart’s delight;
     I set myself to execute thine 112 orders ever, at every step.
     I hate men who are half and 113 half, I love thy law;
     I await thy promise, thou 114 my shield and shelter.
     Begone, you villains, let me 115 keep my God’s com­mands!
         116 	Uphold me, as thou hast prom­
     ised, disappoint not my hope, but let me live;
         117 	hold me up safe, let me de­
     light for ever in thy will. 1x8 All who swerve from thy will, thou spumest; their no­tions end in nothing.
         119 	I count all the ungodly so
     much dross; I love thy ride and order;
         120 	my being shudders before
     thee, in awe of thy judg­ments.
         121 	Leave me not to be oppressed,
     for I have done right and justice;
         122 	pledge thy word to succour
     me, let not the arrogant op­press me;
         123 	I pine with looking for thy
     rescue, for thy saving promise.
         124 	Deal in kindness with thy serv­
     ant, teach thy laws to me;
         125 	instruct thy servant, let me
     understand thine orders.
         126 	High time for thee to act!—
     men break thy law;
         127 	but I love thy commands
     above all things, above solid gold;
         128 	I order all my life by thy
     behests, I hate all godless ways.
         129 	Thy laws are a wondrous mys­
     tery — my soul obeys them—
         130 	the interpretation of thy
     words enlightens and in­structs the open-minded;
         131 	and I am open, eager, pant­
     ing for thy commands.
         132 	Turn to me and have pity—it
     is due to those who love thee;
         133 	direct my steps as thou hast
     promised, free from evil influence;
     deliver me from man’s op- 134 pression, that I may do thy behests.
     Smile on thy servant, teach thy 13S laws to me;
     when men are disobedient to 136 thy law, mine eyes stream with tears.
         O 	thou Eternal, thou art just, 137
     thy sentences are true;
     the rules thou hast enjoined 138 are just and absolutely sure.
     Zeal carries me away, when my 139 foes forget thy laws;
     thy promises are tried and 140 true, thy servant loves them;
         I 	am weak and despised, but 141 I never forget thy be­hests.
     Thy justice is eternal justice, 142 and thy law is truth it­self;
     trouble and anguish seize me, 143 but thy commands are my comfort;
     thy laws are ever just; let me 144 know them and so live.
     Answer me as I cry with all my 145 heart, for I would obey thine orders;
         I 	call to thee, O Eternal, help 146 me, and I will do thy bid­ding.
         O 	am up before the dawn to 147
     pray, waiting for thy promises;
         I 	waken through the night to 148 muse upon thy word;
     oh listen—thou art kind; re- 149 vive me—thou art just.
     My pursuers draw near in mal- 150 ice, far away from thy law;
     but, O Eternal, thou art near, 151 all thy commands are true;
         I 	have long seen that thy 152 decrees are valid for all time.
         153 	Look at what I suffer, save me,
     for I never forget	thy
     law;
         154 	take my part, avenge, revive
     me as thou hast promised.
         155 	The ungodly are far from help,
     for they have no mind to thy laws;
         156 	O Eternal, rich in pity, re­
     vive me—thou art just;
         157 	I never swerve from	thy
     control, though many	per­
     secute and press me.
         158 	I loathe apostates, when I see
     how they will not obey thy law;
         159 	look at my own love for thy
     law, and in thy love revive me;
         160 	the sum of thy commands is
     truth, and all thy just commands are ever bind­ing.
         161 	Nobles persecute me wantonly,
     but my heart stands in awe of thy commands.
         162 	In thy promise I delight, as
     in ample spoil;
         163 	ungodliness I hate and I ab­
     hor, but I do love thy law.
         164 	Seven times a day I praise thee
     for the justice of thy rule;
         165 	right well they fare who
     love thy law; their road is clear.
         166 	I do thy bidding, O Eternal,
     and I hope for thy deliv­erance;
         167 	my soul obeys thy laws, I
     love them dearly;
         168 	I obey thy laws and thy be­
     hests, I live all my life under thine eye.
         169 	Let my cry come before thee, O
     Eternal, enlighten me as thou hast promised;
         170 	let my entreaty reach thee,
     and relieve me as thou hast promised.
     Let my lips praise thee for 171 teaching me thine orders; let me sing of thy word, for 172 just are all thy commands; let thy hand come to my 173 help, for I have chosen to obey thee.
     I am longing for thy help, O thou Eternal, and thy law is my delight;
     let me live that I may 175 praise thee, help me by thy judgments;
     seek out thy servant in his 176 wanderings, for I forget not thy commands.
     A •pilgrim song.
     I cried to the Eternal minA my woe—and the	1
     Eternal answered me—
     “Save me from lying lips and 2 crafty tongues!”
     What will you get from Him, O 3 crafty tongue, what punish­ment in full?
     Sharp arrows poured on you, 4 and burning coals!
     Alas, I have to dwell in Me- 5 shek!
     Alas, I have to live in Kedar’s tents!
     Too long have I been living 6 where men hate peace;
     however peaceably I talk, they 7 are for war.
     A pilgrim song.
     I lift mine eyes to the 1 ni 1 mountains; ah, where is help to come from?
     Help comes from the Eternal 2 who made heaven and earth.
     Never will he let you slip; he 3 who guards you never sleeps:
     he who guards Israel will 4 neither sleep nor slumber.
     The Eternal guards you, shel- 5 tering you upon the right;
         6 	the sun shall never hurt you in
     the day, nor the moon by night.
         7 	The Eternal will guard you
     from all harm, he will pre­serve your life;
         8 	he will protect you as you come
     and go, now and for ever­more.
     A -pilgrim song, by David.
         1 	ian I am glad whenever
     they tell me, “We go to the Eternal’s house,” a glad when our feet stand at last inside Jerusalem—
         1 	Jerusalem that is now rebuilt, a
     city solid and unbroken.
         2 	Thither go the clans on pilgrim­
     age, the Eternal’s clans,
         3 	to offer the Eternal praise, as he
     prescribed for Israel [[there were the seats of justice, the royal tribunals of Da­vid]].
     .6 Pray for the welfare of Jerusa­lem, “May all thy homes be safe,
         7 	may all go well within thy walls,
     within thy palaces!”
         8 	For the sake of my friends and
     fellows I pray, “May all be well with thee!”
         9 	For the sake of the house of our
     God the Eternal, I would have thee prosper.
     A pilgrim song.
     lino To thee I lift mine eyes, enthroned in
     heaven.
         1 	As the eyes of servants are fixed
     on the hand of their lord,
     and as a maid’s eyes on the hand of her mistress,
     so our eyes look to our God, the Eternal, till he take pity on us.
     Take pity on us, O Eternal, oh 3 take pity;
     for we have had our fill, and 4 more, of scorn and sneers,
     from arrogant creatures living at their ease.
     A pilgrim song, by David.
     “Had not the Eternal 1	1
     been upon our side”—
     so let Israel say—
     “had not the Eternal been upon 2 our side,
     when men rose to attack us,
     they would have swallowed us 3 alive,
     so fierce their anger flamed;
     the floods would have swept us 4 away,
     the streams would have surged over us,
     surging clean over us,	5
     with proud, wild waves.
     But, blessed be the Eternal!	6
     he did not leave us for their teeth to tear;
     we escaped like a bird from the 7 fowler’s snare— the snare broke, we escaped!
     Our help lies in the Eternal, 8
     who made heaven and earth!”
     A pilgrim song.
     Those who trust in the inp i Eternal are like Sion hill, never to be shaken;
     Jerusalem sits enthroned for 2 ever, with the hills around her,
     and the Eternal is around his people now and evermore.
     He 'null not leave the land of the 3 just under the sway of knaves;
     or else just men themselves might take to evil.
         O 	thou Eternal, be good to the 4 good, to those who are upright in heart;
     5 as for the shifty and disloyal— may the Eternal scatter them [[with evildoers, and Israel prosper]]!
     A ;pilgrim song.
         1 	I When the Eternal
     brought the exiles back to Sion,
     we were like men who dreamed;
         2 	laughter filled our lips,
     shouts of joy were on our tongues;
     the very heathen said,
     “The Eternal has done great things for them.”
         3 	Yes, great things he had done
     for us,
     and we rejoiced at it.
         4 	O thou Eternal, bring back now
     the rest of our exiles, to fill us up, like streams in the dry south.
         5 	Those who are sowing in tears
     shall reap with shouts of joy;
         6 	sadly they bear seed to the field,
     gladly they bear home the sheaves.
     A pilgrim song, by Solomon.
     i i eyrj Unless the Eternal • builds the house, workmen build in vain; unless the Eternal guards the town,
     sentries are on guard in vain.
     a Vain is it to rise early for your work,
     and keep at work so late, gaining your bread with anxious toil!
     God’s gifts come to his loved ones, as they sleep.
     *• * *
         1 	Sons are a gift of the Eternal, and children are a boon from him.
     Strong sons, born when one is 4 young,
     are like arrows in an archer’s hand;
     happy the man who has a quiver 5 full of them,
     he need not fear to face a hostile band.
     A pilgrim song.
     Happy is everyone who 1 OO 1 reveres the Eternal, L“t) who fives His life!
     You shall earn your daily bread, 2 you happy man and pros­perous!
     Your wife within your house	3
     shall be like a fruitful vine;
     your children, round your table, like slips of olive evergreen.
     Here is the blessing	4
     for one who reveres the Eter­nal!
     The Eternal will send you this 5 blessing from Sion; you shall see Jerusalem flour­ish all your days, you shall five to see your 6 children’s children.
     [[May Israel prosper!]]
     A pilgrim song.
     “Cruelly have they har- T OQ 1 ried me from my youth”— so let Israel say—
     “cruelly have they harried me 2 from my youth, but they have never crushed me.
     The ploughmen ploughed my 3 back,
     and long they drew their furrows;
     but the Eternal, he is just, 4
     he has cut down the ungodly.”
     May all who hate Sion be 5 routed and shamed! let them fare like grass-blades 6 on a roof,
     that fade ere ever they flourish,
         O 	that fill no reaper’s arms,
     that none shall gather as he binds the sheaves,
         1 	that move no passer-by to say,
     “The blessing of the Eternal be upon you!
     In the Eternal’s name we bless you!”

     that thou mayest be wor­shipped.
         5 	So I wait in hope for the Eter­

     there is a wealth of saving power;

     from all their sins.
     A pilgrim song, by David.
         1 	I O] No haughty heart is
     -i- mine, O thou Eter­nal,
     no lofty looks are mine;
         I 	never meddle with high schemes,
     with matters far beyond me.
         1 	No, I have soothed and stilled
     my soul,
     as a mother calms her weaned child;
     my soul is like a weaned child.
         O 	Israel, put your hope in the 3
     Eternal,
     now and for evermore.
     A pilgrim song.
     For David’s sake, Ol 09 65 thou Eternal, re- member all his piety,
     how he swore to the Eternal, 2 vowing to the Mighty One of Jacob,
     “I will not enter my house, I 3 will not lie on my bed,
         1 	will not close my eyes in sleep, 4
     I will not shut my eyelids,
     till I find some residence for the 5 Eternal, some dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
     We heard of the ark at Ephra- 6 thah, we found it in the woodland;
     we went to where he dwelt, and 7 at his footstool knelt:
     “Ascend, Eternal, to thy rest- 8 ing-place, thou and thy mighty ark!—
     thy priests in triumphant array, 9 thy worshippers loudly re­joicing!
     For the sake of thy servant io David, reject not thine own king.”
     The Eternal swore an oath to xi David, and he will not break his word:
     “I will set one of your own sons upon your throne;
     and if your sons will keep my 12 compact and the laws I teach them,
     their sons shall also sit for ever on your throne.”
     For the Eternal has chosen Sion 13 as the seat that he desires;
         12 	“Here is my resting-place,” he
     says, “the seat I choose for evermore;
         13 	I will enrich her food-supplies,
     and satisfy her poor with bread.
         14 	I will robe her priests in tri­
     umph, and make her wor­shippers shout for joy.
         15 	There will I make David’s dy­
     nasty flourish, and my chosen king shine prosper­ously;
         16 	his foes I shroud with dark dis­
     grace, but his own crown shall sparkle.”
     A pilgrim, song, by David.
         1 	TOO How rare it is, how
     lovely,
     this fellowship of those who meet together!—
         2 	sweet as the sacred oil poured on
     the head,
     that flows down Aaron’s beard, down to the very collar of his robe;
         3 	vital as dew of Hermon,
     that falls on the hills of Sion. For in this fellowship has the Eternal fixed
     the blessing of an endless life. A pilgrim song.
         1 	I Qyf Come, all ye servants of J-Ort the Eternal, bless
     the Eternal,
     ye who stand by night in the Eternal’s house,
         2 	lift hands of prayer to the
     shrine, bless the Eternal!
         3 	“And may the Eternal, who
     made heaven and earth, bless you from Sion!” 1
     who stand within the Eternal’s 2
     house,
     in the courts of the house of our God.
     Praise the Eternal, he is good; 3 sing to his name, for he is gracious;
     the Eternal has chosen Jacob to 4 be his,
     and Israel as his prized pos­session.
     We know the Eternal is great, 5 and our Lord high over all gods.
     The Eternal does whate’er he 6 pleases,
     in heaven and earth, the seas and all abysses;
     he makes mists rise from the 7 ends of the earth, sends lightning to bring on the rain,
     and wind out of his store­houses.
     ’Twas he who killed the first- 8 born within Egypt, both of man and beast, who sent portents upon Egypt, 9 on the Pharaoh and on all his servants;
     many a nation he struck down, 10 and mighty kings he slew,
     Sihon king of the Amorites, n Og the king of Bashan, and all the powers of Canaan, giving their land to Israel,	12
     to his people to possess.
     Thy name, O thou Eternal, lives 13 for ever,
     thy fame from age to age; the Eternal will right his peo- 14 pie’s wrongs,
     he will be sorry for his serv­ants.
     Pagan idols are mere gold and 15 silver,
     made by the hands of men,
         13 	with mouths—but they never
     speak,
     with eyes—but they cannot see,
         14 	with ears—but they cannot hear,
     with no breath in their lips!
         15 	So be it with their makers,
     with all who trust in them!
         16 	Bless the Eternal, Israel’s house­
     hold!
     Bless the Eternal, Aaron’s household!

     By the streams of Baby- | 07 1 Ion, there we sat AO 4 and wept at the thought of Sion!
     There on the poplars we hung 2 up our harps,
     when our tyrants asked for a 3 song;
     those who had harried us bade us be merry,
     “Sing us a song of Sion,” they said.
     But how can we sing the Eter- 4 nal’s songs,
     here, in a foreign land?
     Jerusalem, if ever I forget thee, 5
     withered be this my hand!

     plundered us,

     The Eternal intervenes on my 8 behalf:
     Eternal One, thy kindness never fails,
     thou wilt not drop the work thou hast begun.
     From the Choirmaster s collec­tion. A song of David.
     Thou searchest me, "| QA I Eternal One, thou knowest me,
     thou knowest me sitting or 2 rising,
     my very thoughts thou read- est from afar;
     walking or resting, I am scanned 3 by thee,
     and all my life to thee lies open;
     ere ever a word comes to my 4 tongue,
         O 	thou Eternal, ’tis well known to thee;
     thou art on every side, behind 5 me and before,
     laying thy hand on me.
     Such knowledge is too wonder- 6 ful for me;
     it is far, far beyond me.
     Where could I go from thy 7 Spirit,
     where could I flee from thy face?
     I climb to heaven?—but thou 8 art there;
         1 	nestle in the nether­world?—and there thou art!
     If I darted swift to the dawn, 9

     141 praise thee for the awful wonder of my birth; thy work is wonderful.
         1 	For thou didst form my being,
     didst weave me in my mother’s womb.
         2 	Thou knewest all about my soul,

     as I was being moulded secretly and put together in the world below;

     thee!
     How vast the number of thy purposes!
         6 	I try to count them?—they are
     more than the sand;

         7 	O God, that thou would’st slay

     thee, Eternal,
     shall I not loathe these rebels?
         10 	I hate them with a perfect
     hatred,
     I count them enemies to my­self.
         11 	Search me, O God, and know

     They have laid a hidden snare for me
     on the road I have to go;
     I look to right and left,	4
     but no man cares to know; all help has failed me, none cares for my life.
     But thou knowest my path, 3 Eternal One, I cry to thee; 5 I say, “Thou art my help,
     I have thee as my very own, in the land of the living.
     Oh listen to my cry,	6
     for I am brought very low;
     save me from my pursuers, they are too strong for me; bring me from my prison,	7

     A song of David.
         O thou Eternal, hear my prayer,
     listen to my entreaties, as thou art faithful and true, oh answer me;
     put not thy servant on his trial, 2 for before thee no living soul can be acquitted.
     The foe pursues me,	3
     stamps me to the ground; he forces me to dwell in dark­ness,
     like those who have been dead for long.
     And so my spirits faint,	4
     my heart grows numb within me.
         1 	remember the days of old, 5 I meditate on all that thou

         7 	make haste to answer me.
     O thou Eternal, my spirits are failing,
     withhold not thy favour from me,
     lest I become like a dying man.
         8 	Satisfy me with the dawn of
     thy love,

     and raises all who are bowed down.
     All thy creatures look to 15 thee,
     for their food in season due,
     and from thine open hand	16
     they feast upon thy favour.
     Faithful in all his dealings is the 17 Eternal,
     loving in all he does;
     the Eternal is near all who call 18 on him,
     who call on him sincerely;
     he satisfies his worshippers,	19
     he hears their cry and helps them;
     the Eternal preserves all who 20 love him,
     but all the ungodly he de­stroys.
     My lips shall pour out the Eter- 2t nal’s praise;
     let all men bless his sacred name for ever.
     Hallelujah, i	1
     Praise the Eternal, O ±40 my soul!
     As long as I live, I will praise 2 the Eternal,
     and sing to my God, as long as I survive.
     Rely not upon great men—	3
     mere mortals who can give no help;
     when their breath goes, they re- 4 turn to the dust, and on that very day their projects perish.
     Happy the man whose help is 5 Jacob’s God,
     whose hope lies in the Eternal One, his God,
     Maker of heaven and earth 6 and sea, and all they hold.
     He remains ever true, he rights those who are 7 wronged,
     he feeds those who are hungry;
     the Eternal sets the captives free.
         1 	the Eternal gives the blind
     their sight,
     the Eternal raises those who are bowed down,
         2 	the Eternal preserves poor
     foreigners,
     the widow and the orphan he relieves,
         8 	the Eternal loves those who are
     good,
         9 	but the ungodly life he ruins. io The Eternal shall be king for
     ever,
     thy God, O Sion, for all ages. Hallelujah.

     J-*±! 4 Praise the Eternal, for he is good;
     make melody to our God, for he is gracious.
         2 	The Eternal restores Jerusalem,
     he gathers the outcasts of Is­rael,
         3 	he heals the broken-hearted
     and binds up their wounds.
         4 	He fixes the number of the stars,
     and gives a name to each.
         5 	Great is our Lord, mighty in
     power,
     his wisdom is unsearchable.
         6 	The Eternal has relief for the
     afflicted,
     he brings the ungodly to the ground.
         7 	Sing thanks to the Eternal,
     make melody to our God upon the lyre,
         8 	who covers the sky with clouds,
     provides rain for the earth, till grass grows on the very hills,
     and fodder for the beasts that serve mankind,
         9 	who gives wild animals their
     food,
     that cry for it at eventide, io He cares not for the strength of the war-horse,
     delights not in man’s armour;
     the Eternal delights in those ii who revere him, who trust to his own goodness.
     Praise the Eternal, O Jerusalem, 12 praise your God, O Sion; for he has fortified your gate- 13
     ways,
     and blessed your citizens within,
     has made Peace guard your 14 boundaries,
     and filled you with the finest wheat.
     He issues his commands to 15 earth,
     his orders run apace, showering snow white as wool, 16 scattering hoar-frost thick as ashes,
     casting hail-stones down like 17 crumbs.
     The waters freeze; he sends an order, and they 18 melt;
     once he makes the wind blow, then the waters flow.
     He makes his purpose known to 19 Jacob,
     his orders and his laws to Is­rael;
     never has he done so to other 20 nations—
     they know not his commands.
     Hallelujah. *| a o i Praise the Eternal from the heavens,

     for Israel, a folk pleasing to him.

     this is an honour for God’s faithful ones.
