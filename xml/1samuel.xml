     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.1" osisID="1Sam.1.1"/>There was a man of Ramah, a Zuphite from the highlands of Ephraim, whose name
       was Elkanah---the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph. He was an Ephraimite, <verse eID="1Sam.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.2" osisID="1Sam.1.2"/> and he had two wives, one called Hannah and the other Peninnah; Peninnah had
       children, but Hannah had no children. <verse eID="1Sam.1.2"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.3" osisID="1Sam.1.3"/> Now this man used to go up from his town, year by year, to worship and to
       sacrifice to the Lord of hosts at Shilo, where Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the
       Eternal. <verse eID="1Sam.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.4" osisID="1Sam.1.4"/> He used to give his wife Penin­nah and all her sons and daugh­ters shares of
       the sacrificial meat, <verse eID="1Sam.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.5" osisID="1Sam.1.5"/> but, though he loved Hannah, he gave her only a sin­gle share, because the
       Eternal had shut up her womb. <verse eID="1Sam.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.6" osisID="1Sam.1.6"/> Her rival used to taunt her bit­terly, to irritate her, because the Eternal
       had shut up her womb; <verse eID="1Sam.1.6"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.7" osisID="1Sam.1.7"/> and this went on year after year--whenever she went up to the house of the
       Eternal, she taunted Hannah. <verse eID="1Sam.1.7"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.4" osisID="1Sam.1.4"/> One day when Elkanah was sacrificing, Hannah wept and would not eat. <verse eID="1Sam.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.8" osisID="1Sam.1.8"/> So her husband Elkanah said to her, <q>Hannah, why are you weeping? Why are
       you not eating? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?</q> <verse eID="1Sam.1.8"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.9" osisID="1Sam.1.9"/> But after they had eaten the boiled flesh and had drunk, Hannah rose and
       stood before the Eternal where Eli the priest was sitting on his chair at the door­posts of the temple of the Eternal.
      <verse eID="1Sam.1.9"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.10" osisID="1Sam.1.10"/> With a sore heart she prayed to the Eternal, weeping bitterly, <verse eID="1Sam.1.10"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.11" osisID="1Sam.1.11"/> and she made this vow: <q>O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt in­deed look upon
       the plight of thy servant and remember me and not forget thy servant, but wilt give thy servant a son, then I will
       give him to the Eternal for the whole of his life; and no razor shall ever touch his head.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.1.11"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.12" osisID="1Sam.1.12"/> As she went on praying before the Eternal, Eli noticed her mouth--<verse eID="1Sam.1.12"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.13" osisID="1Sam.1.13"/> for Hannah was speaking to herself; only her lips moved, her voice was not
       heard. Eli thought she was drunk. <verse eID="1Sam.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.14" osisID="1Sam.1.14"/> So Eli said to her, <q>How long will you go on, you drunken creature? Away
       with you, go and sleep off your drunkenness!</q> <verse eID="1Sam.1.14"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.15" osisID="1Sam.1.15"/> But Hannah replied, <q>No, sir, I am a sorely tried woman, I have drunk
       neither wine nor liquor; I have been pouring out my soul be­fore the Eternal. <verse eID="1Sam.1.15"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.16" osisID="1Sam.1.16"/> Do not take your servant for a depraved woman; it is under my stress of
       grief and provocation that I have been speaking all the time.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.1.16"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.17" osisID="1Sam.1.17"/> Then Eli answered, <q>Go and prosper; may the God of Israel grant you what
       you have asked him!</q> <verse eID="1Sam.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.18" osisID="1Sam.1.18"/> And she said, <q>May your servant find favour in your eyes!</q> <verse eID="1Sam.1.18"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.19" osisID="1Sam.1.19"/> So the woman went away; she ate, and her face was sad no longer. In the
       morning they rose, worshipped before the Eternal, and returned home to Ramah. Elkanah had inter­course with Hannah his
       wife, and the Eternal remembered her; <verse eID="1Sam.1.19"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.20" osisID="1Sam.1.20"/> so Hannah conceived, and at the turn of the year she bore a son, calling
       his name Samuel or <q>God-asked.</q> <q>For,</q> she said, <q>I asked the Eternal for him.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.1.20"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.21" osisID="1Sam.1.21"/> Elkanah went up with all
       <milestone type="pb" n="307"/>
       his household to offer to the Eternal the yearly sacrifice and what he had vowed, <verse eID="1Sam.1.21"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.22" osisID="1Sam.1.22"/> but Hannah did not go up. <q>Once the child is weaned,</q> she told her
       husband, <q>then I will bring him; we shall appear before the Eternal, and he shall remain there for ever.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.1.22"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.23" osisID="1Sam.1.23"/> Elkanah her husband said to her, <q>Do what­ever you think right; wait
       till you have weaned him, and may the Eternal let you carry out your purpose.</q> So Hannah waited and suckled her son
       till she weaned him. <verse eID="1Sam.1.23"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.24" osisID="1Sam.1.24"/> Then, after weaning him, she took him with her, along with a
       three-year-old bullock, a bushel of flour, and a bottle of wine; she entered the house of the Eternal at Shilo,
       accompanied by the boy, <verse eID="1Sam.1.24"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.25" osisID="1Sam.1.25"/> and, after the bullock had been slain, she brought the boy to Eli. <verse eID="1Sam.1.25"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.26" osisID="1Sam.1.26"/> <q>As sure as you live, sir,</q> she said, <q>I am the woman who stood
       beside you here, praying to the Eternal. <verse eID="1Sam.1.26"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.27" osisID="1Sam.1.27"/> I prayed about this boy, and the Eternal has granted me what I asked. <verse eID="1Sam.1.27"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.1.28" osisID="1Sam.1.28"/> So I have lent him to the Eternal; as long as he lives he is loaned to the
       Eternal.</q><verse eID="1Sam.1.28"/>

     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.1" osisID="1Sam.2.1"/>[[Hannah sang this prayer:
      <lg>
       <l> My heart thrills to the Eternal, </l>
       <l> my powers are heightened by my God, </l>
       <l> my lips exult over my foes, </l>

       <l> None is divine like the Eternal, </l>

       <l> No more of your proud vaunts! </l>
       <l> No mouthing of your taunts! </l>
       <l> For the Eternal is a God who knows it all, </l>

      <verse sID="1Sam.2.4" osisID="1Sam.2.4"/>
       <l> The strong man’s bow is broken, </l>

       <l> those who had plenty have to work for bread, </l>
       <l> and hungry people have to toil no more; </l>

       <l> the Eternal makes poor, the Eternal makes rich, </l>

       <l> he lifts the poor out of the dust, </l>

     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.11" osisID="1Sam.2.11"/> Then Hannah left him there before the Eternal, and went to Hamah; but the
       boy ministered to the Eternal in presence of Eli the priest. <verse eID="1Sam.2.11"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.12" osisID="1Sam.2.12"/> Now the sons of Eli were depraved creatures; they cared nothing for the
       Eternal nor for the regular dues of a priest. <verse eID="1Sam.2.12"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.13" osisID="1Sam.2.13"/> Whenever a man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, as the
       flesh was being boiled, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, <verse eID="1Sam.2.13"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.14" osisID="1Sam.2.14"/> which he plunged into the pot or kettle or basin or dish; whatever the
       fork brought up, the priest took for himself. So they treated ail the Israelites who came to sac­rifice at Shilo to
       the Eternal. <verse eID="1Sam.2.14"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.15" osisID="1Sam.2.15"/> In fact, even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant
       <milestone type="pb" n="308"/>
       would come and tell the man who was sacrificing, <q>Let the priest have some flesh for roast­ing; he wants raw flesh
       from you, not boiled.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.2.15"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.16" osisID="1Sam.2.16"/> If the man said to him, <q>First let the fat be burned, and then take as
       much as you want,</q> he would answer, <q>No, you must give it to me at once, or I will take it by force.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.2.16"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.17" osisID="1Sam.2.17"/> The sin of the young men was very great before the Eternal, for it meant
       disdain of what was offered to the Eternal. <verse eID="1Sam.2.17"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.18" osisID="1Sam.2.18"/> Samuel, a boy girt with a linen apron, ministered before the Eternal, <verse eID="1Sam.2.18"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.19" osisID="1Sam.2.19"/> and his mother used to make him a little robe, which she brought to him
       year by year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. <verse eID="1Sam.2.19"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.20" osisID="1Sam.2.20"/> Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying,<q>May the Eternal repay
       you with off­spring from this woman, for the loan she has made to the Eter­nal!</q> Then they would go home. <verse eID="1Sam.2.20"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.21" osisID="1Sam.2.21"/> And the Eternal re­membered Hannah, so that she conceived and bore three
       sons and two daughters. Meantime the boy Samuel grew up before the Eternal. <verse eID="1Sam.2.21"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.22" osisID="1Sam.2.22"/> Now Eli was very old. When­ever he heard how his sons were behaving
       towards all Israel, and how they lay with the women caretakers at the door of the Trysting tent, <verse eID="1Sam.2.22"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.23" osisID="1Sam.2.23"/> he said to them, <q>Why are you behaving like this? I hear of it from all
       the people. <verse eID="1Sam.2.23"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.24" osisID="1Sam.2.24"/> No, my sons, it is no good report that I hear the people of the Eternal
       repeating. <verse eID="1Sam.2.24"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.25" osisID="1Sam.2.25"/> If one man sins against another man, God will mediate for him, but if a
       man sins against the Eternal, who can intercede on hi behalf?</q> However, they would not listen to what their
       father said, for the Eternal was resolved to slay them. <verse eID="1Sam.2.25"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.26" osisID="1Sam.2.26"/> Meantime Samuel grew up to be a fine boy in the eyes of the Eter­nal and
       of men. <verse eID="1Sam.2.26"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.27" osisID="1Sam.2.27"/> Now a man of God came to Eli and gave him this message from the Eternal.
       <q>Did I not reveal myself to your father's household when they were in Egypt, slaves to the court of the Pharaoh?
      <verse eID="1Sam.2.27"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.28" osisID="1Sam.2.28"/> Did I not choose him from all the clans of Israel to be my priest, to go
       up to my altar, to burn sacrifice, and to bear the ephod in my presence? Did I not assign to your father's household
       as food all that the Israelites offer by fire? <verse eID="1Sam.2.28"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.29" osisID="1Sam.2.29"/> Why, then, do you cast an envious eye upon my sacrifices and offer­ings,
       letting your sons override me and fattening yourselves under my very eyes upon the first-fruits of all that Israel
       my people offers? <verse eID="1Sam.2.29"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.30" osisID="1Sam.2.30"/> Therefore the Eternal, the God of Israel, de­clares, I had meant your
       house­hold and your father's house­hold to live in my favour for ever; but now, says the Eternal, far be that from me;
       those who honour me I will honour, and those who despise me shall be derided. <verse eID="1Sam.2.30"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.31" osisID="1Sam.2.31"/> The day is coming when I will cut off your off­spring and the offspring of
       your father’s household till there is not an old man left in your household; <verse eID="1Sam.2.31"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.32" osisID="1Sam.2.32"/> then in your straits you shall look enviously on all the prosperity I
       award to Is­rael. <verse eID="1Sam.2.32"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.33" osisID="1Sam.2.33"/> One of your family I will not cut off from my altar, I will spare him to
       consume his eyes with longing and to wear out his heart; but the greater part of your household shall die by the
       sword of men. <verse eID="1Sam.2.33"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.34" osisID="1Sam.2.34"/> What is to befall your two sons Hophni and Phinehas shall be an omen for
       you; both are to die on the
       <milestone type="pb" n="309"/>
       same day. <verse eID="1Sam.2.34"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.35" osisID="1Sam.2.35"/> But I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who is to do whatever I
       plan and desire; I will found a family for him that lasts; he shall live in the favour of my anointed king for ever,
      <verse eID="1Sam.2.35"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.2.36" osisID="1Sam.2.36"/> and any survivor of your household shall come and do him obeisance for a
       pit­tance of money and a piece of bread, crying, <q>Do put me in some priestly position, that I may get a bite of
       food to eat.</q></q> <verse eID="1Sam.2.36"/>

    <chapter osisID="1Sam.3" sID="1Sam.3"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.1" osisID="1Sam.3.1"/>The boy Samuel was minis­tering to the Eternal in pres­ence of Eli. A word
       from the Eternal was rare in those days; <verse eID="1Sam.3.1"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.2" osisID="1Sam.3.2"/> visions were not common. But one day, after Eli had lain down in his place
       (his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see), <verse eID="1Sam.3.2"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.3" osisID="1Sam.3.3"/> when the lamp of God was still burning, and Samuel was lying in the temple
       of the Eternal beside the ark of God, <verse eID="1Sam.3.3"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.4" osisID="1Sam.3.4"/> then the Eternal called, <q>Samuel! Samuel!</q> He answered, <q>Here I
       am,</q> <verse eID="1Sam.3.4"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.5" osisID="1Sam.3.5"/> and ran to Eli, saying, <q>Here I am; you called me.</q> But he said,
       <q>I did not call you; lie down again.</q> So he went and lay down. <verse eID="1Sam.3.5"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.6" osisID="1Sam.3.6"/> Once more the Eternal called, <q>Sam­uel! Samuel!</q> Then Samuel got up and
       went to Eli; <q>Here I am,</q> he said; <q>you did call me.</q> But he answered, <q>I did not call you, my son; lie
        down 7 again.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.3.6"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.7" osisID="1Sam.3.7"/> Now Samuel did not yet know the Eternal, and the word of the Eternal had
       not yet been disclosed to him. <verse eID="1Sam.3.7"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.8" osisID="1Sam.3.8"/> So when the Eternal called Samuel again, the third time, he got up and went
       to Eli, saying, <q>Here I am; you did call me.</q> Eli now saw that the Eternal was calling the lad; <verse eID="1Sam.3.8"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.9" osisID="1Sam.3.9"/> so Eli told Samuel, <q>Go and lie down; if you are called, you must say,
       <q>Speak, O Eternal; thy servant is listening.</q></q> Then Samuel went and lay down in his place, <verse eID="1Sam.3.9"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.10" osisID="1Sam.3.10"/> and the Eternal came and stood, calling as usual, <q>Sam­uel! Samuel!</q>
       Samuel said, <q>Speak, thy servant is listen­ing</q>; <verse eID="1Sam.3.10"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.11" osisID="1Sam.3.11"/> and the Eternal said to Samuel, <q>I am about to do a deed in Israel that
       will make the ears of all who hear it ring; <verse eID="1Sam.3.11"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.12" osisID="1Sam.3.12"/> on that day I will execute against Eli all that I have said about his
       household from be­ginning to end. <verse eID="1Sam.3.12"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.13" osisID="1Sam.3.13"/> You must tell him that I will punish his house­hold for ever, because he
       knew that his sons were blaspheming God and yet he did not check them. <verse eID="1Sam.3.13"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.14" osisID="1Sam.3.14"/> Therefore have I sworn to the household of Eli that the guilt of Eli's
       household shall never be expiated, neither by sacrifices nor by offering.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.3.14"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.15" osisID="1Sam.3.15"/> Samuel lay till morning; in the morning he rose and opened the doors of
       the house of the Eter­nal, but he was afraid to let Eli know the vision. <verse eID="1Sam.3.15"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.16" osisID="1Sam.3.16"/> Eli called Samuel, however, and said, <q>Samuel, my son.</q> <q>Here I
       am,</q> he said. <verse eID="1Sam.3.16"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.3.17" osisID="1Sam.3.17"/> And he said, <q>What was it that the Eternal told you? Come, do not hide

      <verse sID="1Sam.4.1" osisID="1Sam.4.1"/> In those days the Philistines mustered to make war on Israel; Israel
       marched out to fight the Philistines and camped at Help-stone, while the Philistines camped at Aphek.
      <verse eID="1Sam.4.1"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.4.2" osisID="1Sam.4.2"/> The Philis­tines drew up in battle array against Israel; it was a stiff
       fight, but Israel was routed before the Philistines, who slew four thousand of their army in the open country. <verse eID="1Sam.4.2"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.4.3" osisID="1Sam.4.3"/> When the troops returned to their camp, the sheikhs of Israel said, 
      <q>Why has the Eternal routed us to-day before the Phil­istines? Let us fetch the ark of our God from Shilo, that he
       may come among us and rescue us from the power of our enemies.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.4.3"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.4.4" osisID="1Sam.4.4"/> So the people sent to Shilo and brought away the ark of the Eternal
       (throned on the kherubs), and, along with the ark of God, Eli’s two sons Hophni and Phinehas. <verse eID="1Sam.4.4"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.4.5" osisID="1Sam.4.5"/> When the ark of the Eternal reached the camp, all Is­rael raised a mighty
       shout, till the earth resounded; <verse eID="1Sam.4.5"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.4.6" osisID="1Sam.4.6"/> and when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, <q>What
       is this noise of mighty shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?</q> When they learned that the ark of the Eternal had
       arrived in the camp, <verse eID="1Sam.4.6"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.4.7" osisID="1Sam.4.7"/> the Philistines were afraid. <q>These are their gods,</q> they said, <q>who
       have come to them in camp!</q> <q>Woe to us!</q> they said, <q>This has never hap­pened before. <verse eID="1Sam.4.7"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.4.8" osisID="1Sam.4.8"/> Woe to us! Who can rescue us from the power of these mighty gods? These are

      <verse sID="1Sam.4.11" osisID="1Sam.4.11"/> the ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons perished, Hophni and

      <verse sID="1Sam.4.15" osisID="1Sam.4.15"/> [[Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were so dim that he could

      <verse sID="1Sam.4.17" osisID="1Sam.4.17"/> The messenger said, <q>Israel fled be­fore the Philistines, there was a

      <verse sID="1Sam.4.18" osisID="1Sam.4.18"/> When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell back from his seat beside the

      <verse sID="1Sam.4.19" osisID="1Sam.4.19"/> His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and on the point

      <verse sID="1Sam.4.20" osisID="1Sam.4.20"/> As she was dying, the women standing round her said to her, <q>Fear not,

      <verse sID="1Sam.5.3" osisID="1Sam.5.3"/> But when the folk of Ashdod rose next morning, and went to the temple of

      <verse sID="1Sam.5.4" osisID="1Sam.5.4"/> They lifted up Dagon and put him in his place again. But when they rose

      <verse sID="1Sam.5.5" osisID="1Sam.5.5"/> (This is why the priests of Dagon, and all who enter the temple of Dagon,

     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.5.6" osisID="1Sam.5.6"/> Then the Eternal laid a heavy hand upon the folk of Ashdod; he wasted them,

      <verse sID="1Sam.5.9" osisID="1Sam.5.9"/> but, after they had brought it round, the hand of the Eternal struck that

      <verse sID="1Sam.5.10" osisID="1Sam.5.10"/> So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to

      <verse sID="1Sam.6.5" osisID="1Sam.6.5"/> So you must make images of your tu­mours and images of your mice that are

      <verse sID="1Sam.9.20" osisID="1Sam.9.20"/> As for your asses that were lost three days ago, do not worry about

      <verse sID="1Sam.9.21" osisID="1Sam.9.21"/> Saul answered, <q>Am I not a Benjamite, a member of the smallest clan in

      <verse sID="1Sam.9.22" osisID="1Sam.9.22"/> But Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.29" osisID="1Sam.14.29"/> Then Jonathan said, <q>My father has undone the na­tion! Look how

     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.14.31" osisID="1Sam.14.31"/> From noon to nightfall, they struck down the Philistines that day,

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.32" osisID="1Sam.14.32"/> then the troops rushed on the spoil, seizing sheep, oxen, and
       calves, and felling them to the earth; the troops ate them, blood and all. <verse eID="1Sam.14.32"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.14.33" osisID="1Sam.14.33"/> But when Saul was told, <q>the troops are sinning against the
       Eternal by eating flesh with the blood in it,</q> he said to his informants, <q>Roll a large altar-stone
       here.</q> <verse eID="1Sam.14.33"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.14.34" osisID="1Sam.14.34"/> Saul added, <q>Go through the troops and tell them that every man
       is to bring me his ox or sheep and slay it here; they are not to sin against the Eternal by eating flesh with
       the blood in it.</q> So all the troops brought to the Eternal what each had in his hand, and slew it there. <verse eID="1Sam.14.34"/>
      <verse sID="1Sam.14.35" osisID="1Sam.14.35"/> Thus Saul put up an altar to the Eternal; it was the first altar

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.36" osisID="1Sam.14.36"/> Then Saul said, <q>Let us go down to pursue the Philistines by

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.37" osisID="1Sam.14.37"/> So Saul asked God, <q>Shall I go down to pursue the Philistines?

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.38" osisID="1Sam.14.38"/> So Saul said, <q>Come here, all you chieftains of the army,

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.41" osisID="1Sam.14.41"/> Then Saul prayed, <q>O thou Eternal, God of Israel, why hast thou

       and Jonathan were taken by the lot; the army escaped. Then Saul said, <q>Throw the lot between me and Jonathan

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.43" osisID="1Sam.14.43"/> <q>Tell me,</q> said Saul to Jonathan, <q>what have you done?</q>
       Jonathan told him, <q>I did taste a morsel of honey on the tip of the club I was carrying. Here I am! I am

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.44" osisID="1Sam.14.44"/> <q>God kill me and worse, Jona­than,</q> said Saul, <q>but die you

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.45" osisID="1Sam.14.45"/> However, the army said to Saul, <q>Jonathan die!--Jonathan who won
       this great victory for Israel? Never! By the life of the Eternal, not a hair of his head shall fall to the

      <verse sID="1Sam.14.46" osisID="1Sam.14.46"/> Saul gave up his pursuit of the Philistines, and the Philistines

      <verse sID="1Sam.15.7" osisID="1Sam.15.7"/> and Saul routed the Amalekites from Telem as far as to Shur on the

      <verse sID="1Sam.15.8" osisID="1Sam.15.8"/> he took Agag king of Amalek alive, and massacred all the people,

      <verse sID="1Sam.15.21" osisID="1Sam.15.21"/> But the troops took some of the sheep and oxen, the best of what

     <p>
      <verse sID="1Sam.15.24" osisID="1Sam.15.24"/> Then said Saul to Samuel, <q>I have done wrong: I have broken the

      <verse sID="1Sam.15.25" osisID="1Sam.15.25"/> Pray pardon my sin, come back with me that I may worship the

      <verse sID="1Sam.16.5" osisID="1Sam.16.5"/> <q>Yes,</q> he replied, <q>I have come to sacri­fice to the Eternal.

      <verse sID="1Sam.16.8" osisID="1Sam.16.8"/> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and put him before Samuel; but he said,
