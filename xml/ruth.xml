     <p>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.1" osisID="Ruth.1.1"/>In the days when the heroes governed, there was a fam­ine in the land, and a
       man of Bethlehem in Judah went to re­side in the country of Moab, along with his wife and his two sons; <verse eID="Ruth.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.2" osisID="Ruth.1.2"/> the man’s name was Elimelek, his wife’s name was Naomi, and his two sons were
       called Mahlon and Kilion, all Ephrathites belonging to Beth­lehem in Judah. They went to the country of Moab and
       re­mained there. <verse eID="Ruth.1.2"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.3" osisID="Ruth.1.3"/> Elimelek the husband of Naomi died, leaving her with her two sons, <verse eID="Ruth.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.4" osisID="Ruth.1.4"/> who married women of Moab, the one called Orpah and the other Ruth. After they
       had stayed there for about ten years <verse eID="Ruth.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.5" osisID="Ruth.1.5"/> both Mahlon and Kilion died, so that Naomi was bereft of her two children and
       her husband. <verse eID="Ruth.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.6" osisID="Ruth.1.6"/> Then, as she heard in the country of Moab that the Eternal had remem­bered
       kindly to give his people food, she started home with her daughters-in-law from the country of Moab. <verse eID="Ruth.1.6"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.7" osisID="Ruth.1.7"/> She went from the place where she was, along with her two daughters-in-law;
       but, as they were setting out to go back to the land of Judah, <verse eID="Ruth.1.7"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.8" osisID="Ruth.1.8"/> Naomi said to her two daugh­ters-in-law, <q>You go back, each of you, to her
       mother’s house. May the Eternal treat you kindly, as you have treated the dead and myself! <verse eID="Ruth.1.8"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.9" osisID="Ruth.1.9"/> May the Eternal let each of you find a settlement in the house of a husband!</q>
       Then she kissed them. But they wept loudly <verse eID="Ruth.1.9"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.10" osisID="Ruth.1.10"/> and said to her, <q>No, we will go back with you to your people.</q>
      <verse eID="Ruth.1.10"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.11" osisID="Ruth.1.11"/> Naomi said, <q>Turn back, my daughters, why will you come with me? Have I
       any more sons in my womb to be husbands for you? <verse eID="Ruth.1.11"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.12" osisID="Ruth.1.12"/> Turn back, my daughters, go your way; I am too old to have a husband. Were
       I to say that I had hopes of marrying, if I even had a husband this night and bore sons, <verse eID="Ruth.1.12"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.13" osisID="Ruth.1.13"/> would you wait on till they had grown up? Would you let that debar you
       from marrying? No, my daughters, my plight is worse than yours, for the Eternal is against me.</q> <verse eID="Ruth.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.14" osisID="Ruth.1.14"/> Again they wept aloud; Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to
       her. <verse eID="Ruth.1.14"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.15" osisID="Ruth.1.15"/> Naomi said, <q>Look, your sister-in-law is going back to her people and to
       her gods; turn back after her.</q> <verse eID="Ruth.1.15"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.16" osisID="Ruth.1.16"/> But Ruth said, <q>Entreat me not to leave you and to turn back from
       following you; wher­ever you go, there will I go; wherever you stay, there will I stay; your people shall be my people,
       and your God shall be my God; <verse eID="Ruth.1.16"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.17" osisID="Ruth.1.17"/> wherever you die, there will I die, and beside you will I be buried. May
       the Eternal kill me and worse, if anything but death part you and me.</q> <verse eID="Ruth.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.18" osisID="Ruth.1.18"/> So when Naomi saw that she was determined to ac­company her, she said no
       more. <verse eID="Ruth.1.18"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.19" osisID="Ruth.1.19"/> The two went on till they reached Bethlehem. And the whole town was
       stirred by their arrival. The women said, <q>Is this Naomi?</q> <verse eID="Ruth.1.19"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.20" osisID="Ruth.1.20"/> <q>Call me not Naomi,</q> she said, <q>call me Mara, for the Almighty has
       cruelly marred me; <verse eID="Ruth.1.20"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.21" osisID="Ruth.1.21"/> I left this place full, and the Eternal has brought me back empty-handed.
       Why call me Naomi, when the Eternal has turned against me, and the Almighty has afflicted
       <milestone type="pb" n="302"/>
       me?</q> <verse eID="Ruth.1.21"/>
      <verse sID="Ruth.1.22" osisID="Ruth.1.22"/> This was how Naomi came back, with Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law,
       from the country of Moab; the barley harvest was beginning when they reached Bethlehem. <verse eID="Ruth.1.22"/>
