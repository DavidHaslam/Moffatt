       and their fat, Moses burned it on the altar; <verse eID="Lev.8.16"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.17" osisID="Lev.8.17"/> but the skin, flesh, and dung of the bullock he burned up outside the camp, as
       the Eternal had commanded him. <verse eID="Lev.8.17"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.18" osisID="Lev.8.18"/> He then brought the ram of the burnt-offering, and, after Aaron and his sons
       had laid their hands upon the head of the ram, <verse eID="Lev.8.18"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.19" osisID="Lev.8.19"/> Moses slaughtered it, splashing the blood all round the sides of the altar. <verse eID="Lev.8.19"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.20" osisID="Lev.8.20"/> He cut up the ram, burning the pieces, with the head and the suet, <verse eID="Lev.8.20"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.21" osisID="Lev.8.21"/> and washing the entrails and legs with water; the whole of this he burned on
       the altar as a burnt-offering with a soothing odour, a fire-offering of the Eternal, as the Eternal had commanded him. <verse eID="Lev.8.21"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.22" osisID="Lev.8.22"/>He then brought the other ram, the ram for the rite of installation; after
       Aaron and his sons had laid their hands upon the head of the ram, <verse eID="Lev.8.22"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.23" osisID="Lev.8.23"/> Moses slaughtered it. Taking some of the blood, he smeared it on the tip of
       Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot; <verse eID="Lev.8.23"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.24" osisID="Lev.8.24"/> then Moses brought Aaron’s sons and smeared some of the blood on the tips of
       their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the great toes of their right feet; the rest of the
       blood Moses splashed all round the sides of the altar. <verse eID="Lev.8.24"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.25" osisID="Lev.8.25"/> Taking the fat of the ram, the fat tail, all the fat on the entrails, the
       lobe of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, with the right thigh; <verse eID="Lev.8.25"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.26" osisID="Lev.8.26"/> taking also one unleavened cake, one cake of bread baked with oil, and one
       pancake, from the basket of unleavened cakes before the Eternal, and placing these on the top of the fat and the
       right thigh, <verse eID="Lev.8.26"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.27" osisID="Lev.8.27"/> he put the whole mass into the hands of Aaron and his sons, and had them
       waved to and fro as an offering before the Eternal. <verse eID="Lev.8.27"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.28" osisID="Lev.8.28"/> Then Moses took it all out of their hands and burned it on the top of the
       burnt-offering upon the altar, as an installation-­offering with a soothing odour, a fire-offering to the Eternal. <verse eID="Lev.8.28"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.29" osisID="Lev.8.29"/> The breast of the ram Moses waved to and fro as an offering before the

      <verse sID="Lev.8.30" osisID="Lev.8.30"/> Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and the blood on the altar,
       sprinkling it over Aaron and his vestments as well as over his sons and their vest­ments, to consecrate Aaron and his
       vestments, and his sons and their vestments. <verse eID="Lev.8.30"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.31" osisID="Lev.8.31"/> Moses further said to Aaron and his sons, <q>Boil the meat at the entrance
       to the Trysting tent and eat it there, with the cakes in the basket of the in­stallation-rite--for so I have been
       commanded to bid Aaron and his sons eat. <verse eID="Lev.8.31"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.32" osisID="Lev.8.32"/> The rest of the meat and cakes you must burn up. <verse eID="Lev.8.32"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.33" osisID="Lev.8.33"/> For seven days you must never leave the entrance to the Trysting tent, till
       the days of your installation are over; the installation is to last for seven days. <verse eID="Lev.8.33"/>
      <verse sID="Lev.8.34" osisID="Lev.8.34"/> What has been now done, has been done by order of the Eternal, as expiation
