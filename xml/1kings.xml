       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.1" osisID="1Kgs.1.1"/> King David was an old man, well advanced in years, and although they covered him
           with the bed-clothes he could not keep himself warm. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.1"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.2" osisID="1Kgs.1.2"/> So his attendants said to the king, <q>Let some young girl be sought for my lord
           the king; let her wait upon the king and take care of him; let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may get
           warmth.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.2"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.3" osisID="1Kgs.1.3"/> All over Israel they sought for a beautiful maiden, and found Abishag of Shunem,
           whom they brought to the king; <verse eID="1Kgs.1.3"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.4" osisID="1Kgs.1.4"/> she was most beautiful, and she took care of the king and attended to him. But
            the king had no intercourse with her. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.4"/>
       </p>
       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.5" osisID="1Kgs.1.5"/> Now Adonijah the son of Haggith prided himself that he was to be king; he set up
            chariots and cavalry of his own, with fifty men to run in front. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.5"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.6" osisID="1Kgs.1.6"/> (Adonijah had been born next to Absalom. His father had never checked him all
            his life, by asking what he meant by his conduct. Also, he was a very handsome fellow.) <verse eID="1Kgs.1.6"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.7" osisID="1Kgs.1.7"/> He negotiated with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, both of
            whom adhered to him and gave him their support, <verse eID="1Kgs.1.7"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.8" osisID="1Kgs.1.8"/> although Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet,
            Shimei, Rei, and David’s veterans, did not side with Adonijah. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.8"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.9" osisID="1Kgs.1.9"/> He then sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatted cattle at the Serpent’s Stone beside
            Fuller’s Spring, inviting all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the royal officials from Judah, <verse eID="1Kgs.1.9"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.10" osisID="1Kgs.1.10"/> but not Nathan the prophet, nor Benaiah, nor the veterans nor his brother
            Solomon. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.10"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.11" osisID="1Kgs.1.11"/> So Nathan went to Solomon's mother Bathsheba and said to her, <q>Have you not
            heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, without the knowledge of David our lord? <verse eID="1Kgs.1.11"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.12" osisID="1Kgs.1.12"/> Come now, let me advise you how to save your own life and the life of your son
            Solomon. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.12"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.13" osisID="1Kgs.1.13"/> Go at once to king David and ask him, <q>My lord, O king, did you not swear to
            your humble servant that Solomon my son should reign after you and sit upon your throne? Why, then, doesAdonijah
            reign?</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.13"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.14" osisID="1Kgs.1.14"/> While you are talking to the king, I will come in behind you and confirm what
            you say.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.14"/>
       </p>
     <p>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.15" osisID="1Kgs.1.15"/> Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber. (The king was a very old man, and
          Abishag of Shunem attended to him.) <verse eID="1Kgs.1.15"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.16" osisID="1Kgs.1.16"/> Bathsheba bowed and did homage to the king, and the king asked what she desired. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.16"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.17" osisID="1Kgs.1.17"/> <q>My lord,</q> she replied, <q>you swore by the Eternal your God to your humble
          servant that her son Solomon was to reign after you and sit upon your throne. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.17"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.18" osisID="1Kgs.1.18"/> And here is Adonijah reigning, though you know nothing of it, my lord king! <verse eID="1Kgs.1.18"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.19" osisID="1Kgs.1.19"/> He has sacrificed oxen, fatted cattle, and sheep, plenty of them, and he has
          invited all the king’s sons, along with Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander-in-chief, but not your servant Solomon. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.19"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.20" osisID="1Kgs.1.20"/> Now, my lord king, all Israel looks to you to decide for them who is to succeed to
          the throne of my lord king. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.20"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.21" osisID="1Kgs.1.21"/> Otherwise the result will be that, when my lord king sleeps with his fathers, I
          and my son Solomon will have to suffer.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.21"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.22" osisID="1Kgs.1.22"/> Just as she was
          <milestone type="pb" n="380"/>
          talking to the king, in came the prophet Nathan. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.22"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.23" osisID="1Kgs.1.23"/> The king was told that the prophet Nathan was present, and as he entered the
          king’s presence he bowed before the king, face to the ground. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.23"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.24" osisID="1Kgs.1.24"/> <q>My lord, O king,</q> said Nathan, <q>have you given orders that Adonijah is to
          reign after you and sit upon your throne? <verse eID="1Kgs.1.24"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.25" osisID="1Kgs.1.25"/> For he has gone down to-day and sacrificed oxen, sheep, and fatted cattle, plenty
          of them, inviting all the king’s sons, with Joab the commander-in-chief and Abiathar the priest. There they are, eating and
          drinking and shouting, <q>Long live king Adonijah!</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.25"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.26" osisID="1Kgs.1.26"/> But I, your humble servant, I and Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
          and your son Solomon have not been invited. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.26"/>
         <verse sID="1Kgs.1.27" osisID="1Kgs.1.27"/> If this is by order of my lord king, then you have not let your servants know who
          is to succeed to the throne of my lord king.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.27"/>
       </p>
       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.28" osisID="1Kgs.1.28"/> King David then ordered Bathsheba to be recalled. She came in and stood before
            the king, <verse eID="1Kgs.1.28"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.29" osisID="1Kgs.1.29"/> and the king swore, <q>By the life of the Eternal who has rescued my life from
            every strait, <verse eID="1Kgs.1.29"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.30" osisID="1Kgs.1.30"/> as I swore to you by the Eternal, the God of Israel, that your son Solomon
            should reign after me and succeed to my throne, so will I do this very day.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.30"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.31" osisID="1Kgs.1.31"/> Bathsheba bowed her face to the ground and did homage to the king; <q>May my
            lord king David live for ever!</q> she cried. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.31"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.32" osisID="1Kgs.1.32"/> Then king David had Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son
            of Jehoiada summoned to his presence. When they appeared before the king, <verse eID="1Kgs.1.32"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.33" osisID="1Kgs.1.33"/> the king said to them, <q>Take your lord’s personal troops, mount my son
            Solomon upon my own mule, and convey him to Gihon; <verse eID="1Kgs.1.33"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.34" osisID="1Kgs.1.34"/> there let him be anointed king over Israel by Zadok the priest and Nathan the
            prophet; blow a trumpet blast and proclaim, <q>Long live king Solomon!</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.34"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.35" osisID="1Kgs.1.35"/> Then march up behind him, as he returns to seat himself on my throne, for he is
            to succeed me, and I appoint him supreme head of Israel and Judah.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.35"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.36" osisID="1Kgs.1.36"/> <q>So be it,</q> said Benaiah the son of Jehoiada to the king. <q>May the
            Eternal confirm this order of my lord king! <verse eID="1Kgs.1.36"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.37" osisID="1Kgs.1.37"/> As the Eternal has been with my lord king, so may he be with Solomon, making his
            throne even greater than the throne of my lord king David!</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.37"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.38" osisID="1Kgs.1.38"/> Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
            foreign body-guard marched down; they mounted Solomon upon king David's mule and conveyed him to Gihon, <verse eID="1Kgs.1.38"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.39" osisID="1Kgs.1.39"/> where Zadok the priest took the vial of oil from the sacred Tent and anointed
            Solomon; a trumpet blast was blown, and the troops all shouted, <q>Long live king Solomon!</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.39"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.40" osisID="1Kgs.1.40"/> The troops all marched up behind him, dancing and cheering in their delight, so
            loudly that the earth seemed to be splitting with their noise. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.40"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.41" osisID="1Kgs.1.41"/> Adonijah and his guests all heard it, as they were finishing their feast.
            Hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab said, <q>What does this uproar in city mean?</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.41"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.42" osisID="1Kgs.1.42"/> Just as he was speaking, in came Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest.
            <q>Come along,</q> said Adonijah, <q>you are an honest fellow, you bring good news.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.42"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.43" osisID="1Kgs.1.43"/> Jonathan answered Adonijah, “But our lord king David has made Solomon
           <milestone type="pb" n="381"/>
            king! <verse eID="1Kgs.1.43"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.44" osisID="1Kgs.1.44"/> The king sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of
            Jehoiada, and the foreign body-guard along with him; they mounted him on the king’s mule; <verse eID="1Kgs.1.44"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.45" osisID="1Kgs.1.45"/> Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him king at Gihon; and they
            have come back rejoicing till the city resounds. That is the noise you heard! <verse eID="1Kgs.1.45"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.46" osisID="1Kgs.1.46"/> Solomon is seated on the throne of the realm, <verse eID="1Kgs.1.46"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.47" osisID="1Kgs.1.47"/> and the royal troops have gone to congratulate our lord king David, shouting,
            <q>God make Solomon's fame greater even than your fame, and his throne greater even than your throne! The king bowed on
                his couch. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.47"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.48" osisID="1Kgs.1.48"/> The king also said, <q>Blessed be the Eternal, the God of Israel, who has
            actually allowed me this day to see a son of mine sitting on my throne!</q></q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.48"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.49" osisID="1Kgs.1.49"/> The guests of Adonijah were all terrified; every man of them got up and went
            home. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.49"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.50" osisID="1Kgs.1.50"/> Adonijah himself, in terror of Solomon, got up and ran to catch hold of the
            knobs of the altar. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.50"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.51" osisID="1Kgs.1.51"/> Solomon was told, <q>Adonijah is terrified of king Solomon; he has caught hold
            of the knobs of the altar, crying, <q>Let king Solomon first of all swear to me that he will not have his servant
            murdered!</q></q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.51"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.52" osisID="1Kgs.1.52"/> Solomon said, <q>If he proves himself an honest man, not a hair of him shall
            fall to the ground; but if he is convicted of crime, then die he must.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.1.52"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.1.53" osisID="1Kgs.1.53"/> Then king Solomon sent and had him taken from the altar; he came and did homage
            to king Solomon, and Solomon bade him go home. <verse eID="1Kgs.1.53"/>
       </p>
      <chapter eID="1Kgs.1"/>
      <chapter osisID="1Kgs.2" sID="1Kgs.2"/>
       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.1" osisID="1Kgs.2.1"/>When David's time to die was near, he gave this charge to his son Solomon. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.1"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.2" osisID="1Kgs.2.2"/> <q>I am going the way of all the earth; be strong then, show yourself a man, <verse eID="1Kgs.2.2"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.3" osisID="1Kgs.2.3"/> and do your duty to the Eternal your God, by living his fife, by following his
            rules and orders and regulations and directions, as written in the law of Moses, so that, whatever you do and wherever you
            turn, you may have success, <verse eID="1Kgs.2.3"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.4" osisID="1Kgs.2.4"/> that the Eternal may fulfil his promise to me that if my children are careful
            how they live, living loyally under his eye with all their mind and all their soul, I shall never lack a man upon the
            throne of Israel. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.4"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.5" osisID="1Kgs.2.5"/> Again, you know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, how he treated the two
            commanders of Israel, Abner the son of Ner and Amasa the son of Jether, how he murdered them, taking vengeance during peace
            for blood shed during war, staining the very girdle round his waist and the shoes on his feet with innocent blood. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.5"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.6" osisID="1Kgs.2.6"/> Choose your own time, but never let his grey head go to the grave in peace. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.6"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.7" osisID="1Kgs.2.7"/> Be kind to the family of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among the guests
            at your table, for they fed me when I fled from your brother Absalom. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.7"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.8" osisID="1Kgs.2.8"/> You have also with you Shimei the Benjamite, the son of Gera, from Bahurim.
            Bitterly did he curse me on the day when I made my way to Mahanaim; but when he came to meet me at the Jordan I swore to
            him by the Eternal that I would not put him to death. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.8"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.9" osisID="1Kgs.2.9"/> Do not you let him go unpunished; you have your wits about you, you know what to
            do with him, to bring down his grey head to death with blood.</q><verse eID="1Kgs.2.9"/>
       </p>
       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.10" osisID="1Kgs.2.10"/> Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in
            <milestone type="pb" n="382"/> David’s burg. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.10"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.11" osisID="1Kgs.2.11"/> For forty years David had reigned over Israel, seven years at Hebron and
            thirty-three years in Jerusalem. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.11"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.12" osisID="1Kgs.2.12"/> Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingdom was firmly
            established. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.12"/>
       </p>
       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.13" osisID="1Kgs.2.13"/> Adonijah the son of Haggith then went to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon and
            bowed before her. <q>Do you come as a friend?</q> she asked. <q>Yes,</q> he answered, <verse eID="1Kgs.2.13"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.14" osisID="1Kgs.2.14"/> adding, <q>I have something to say to you.</q> <q>Say it,</q>  she said; <verse eID="1Kgs.2.14"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.15" osisID="1Kgs.2.15"/> so he went on, <q>You know the kingdom was mine, all Israel fully expected me to be
            king; however, the kingdom has passed from me to my brother, for it was his by the will of the Eternal. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.15"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.16" osisID="1Kgs.2.16"/>Now I am asking you one favour: do not refuse me.</q> <q>Go on,</q> she said. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.16"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.17" osisID="1Kgs.2.17"/> So he continued, <q>Pray ask king Solomon (he will not refuse you) to let me
            have Abishag of Shunem as my wife.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.2.17"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.18" osisID="1Kgs.2.18"/><q>Very well,</q> said Bathsheba, <q>I will speak for you to the king.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.2.18"/>
       </p>
       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.19" osisID="1Kgs.2.19"/> So Bathsheba went to speak to king Solomon on behalf of Adonijah. The king rose
            to meet her and kissed her; then, seating himself on his throne, he had a chair placed for the king’s mother, who seated
            herself at his right hand. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.19"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.20" osisID="1Kgs.2.20"/> <q>I have a small favour to ask from you,</q> she said; <q>do not refuse me.</q>
            <q>Ask it, my mother,</q> said the king, <q>I will not refuse you.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.2.20"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.21" osisID="1Kgs.2.21"/> So she said, <q>Let Abishag of Shunem be given to your brother Adonijah in
            marriage.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.2.21"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.22" osisID="1Kgs.2.22"/> <q>Abishag of Shunem for Adonijah?</q> answered king Solomon. <q>Why do you
            ask that? Ask the kingdom for him as well!--he is my older brother and he has Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of
            Zerulah on his side!</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.2.22"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.23" osisID="1Kgs.2.23"/> And king Solomon swore by the Eternal, <q>God kill me and worse, if this plea of
            Adonijah does not cost him his life! <verse eID="1Kgs.2.23"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.24" osisID="1Kgs.2.24"/> By the life of the Eternal who has established me and set me on the throne of
            my father David and given me a family as he promised, Adonijah shall die this very day!</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.2.24"/>

           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.29" osisID="1Kgs.2.29"/> When Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the Eternal's Tent and was at the

            <q>I fled to the Eternal.</q> Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada to strike him down. <verse eID="1Kgs.2.29"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.30" osisID="1Kgs.2.30"/> Benaiah went to the Eternal's Tent and gave him the king's order to come away.

           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.32" osisID="1Kgs.2.32"/> The Eternal will make his murders fall on his own head, for he struck down two

           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.33" osisID="1Kgs.2.33"/> So shall the guilt of their murder come back upon the head of Joab and his

            Did you not say to me, <q>Very good, I obey?</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.2.42"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.2.43" osisID="1Kgs.2.43"/> Why have you not kept your oath to the Eternal and the orders I enjoined upon

           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.29" osisID="1Kgs.7.29"/> and on these panels were lions, bulls, and kherubs (on the framework,
            above and below the lions, bulls, and kherubs, there was bevelled work); <verse eID="1Kgs.7.29"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.30" osisID="1Kgs.7.30"/> every trolley had four bronze wheels, with bronze axles,
           the four wheels being underneath the framework<verse eID="1Kgs.7.30"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.32" osisID="1Kgs.7.32"/> (axles and wheels were cast in one piece with the trolley),  each
            wheel being two and a half feet high <verse eID="1Kgs.7.32"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.33" osisID="1Kgs.7.33"/> and all the wheels being shaped like chariot wheels  (axles,
            felloes, spokes, and hubs being all of molten bronze);<verse eID="1Kgs.7.33"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.34" osisID="1Kgs.7.34"/>at the four corners of each trolley there were four clamps, each of
            one piece with the trolley,<verse eID="1Kgs.7.34"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.35" osisID="1Kgs.7.35"/>while on the top of the trolley there was a round saucer, nine inches
           high <verse eID="1Kgs.7.35"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.36" osisID="1Kgs.7.36"/> (the flat surface on the sides of the trolley was engraved with
            kherubs, lions, and palm-trees); <verse eID="1Kgs.7.36"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.31" osisID="1Kgs.7.31"/>but the framework was square, not round. <verse eID="1Kgs.7.31"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.37" osisID="1Kgs.7.37"/>This was how the ten trolleys were made, all cast alike, all of the
            same size and shape. <verse eID="1Kgs.7.37"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.38" osisID="1Kgs.7.38"/>Then he made ten bronze pots, each holding three hundred and
            twenty gallons and measuring six feet; one pot rested on each of the ten trolleys,<verse eID="1Kgs.7.38"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.39" osisID="1Kgs.7.39"/>which he placed beside the temple,  five to the south side and
            five to the north side; the tank was placed on the south side of the temple, at the eastern corner. <verse eID="1Kgs.7.39"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.40" osisID="1Kgs.7.40"/> Hiram made the pots, the shovels, and the bowls; he finished all
            his work for king Solomon in building the temple of the Eternal, <verse eID="1Kgs.7.40"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.41" osisID="1Kgs.7.41"/> the two columns, the two rounded capitals on the tops of the columns,
            the two nets of trellis-work to cover the two capitals, <verse eID="1Kgs.7.41"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.42" osisID="1Kgs.7.42"/> the four hundred pomegranates for each trellis-work, <verse eID="1Kgs.7.42"/>

           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.44" osisID="1Kgs.7.44"/> the tank and the twelve bulls under the tank, <verse eID="1Kgs.7.44"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.45" osisID="1Kgs.7.45"/> the pots, shovels, bowls--all these articles made by Hiram for
            king Solomon in the temple of the Eternal were of polished bronze. <verse eID="1Kgs.7.45"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.47" osisID="1Kgs.7.47"/> There was no weighing the bronze used for making these articles,
            so enormous was the quantity; the weight of the bronze was past counting. <verse eID="1Kgs.7.47"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.46" osisID="1Kgs.7.46"/> Hiram cast them on the plain of Jordan, in the clay soil between
            Sukkoth and Zarethan. <verse eID="1Kgs.7.46"/>
       </p>
       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.48" osisID="1Kgs.7.48"/> Then king Solomon placed all the articles in the temple of the Eternal
            [[the golden altar, the golden table for the Presence-bread, <verse eID="1Kgs.7.48"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.49" osisID="1Kgs.7.49"/> the pure gold lampstands in front of the inner shrine, five to the
            right and five to the left, with their golden ornamental flowers and lamps and tongs, <verse eID="1Kgs.7.49"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.50" osisID="1Kgs.7.50"/> the pure gold cups, snuffers, bowls, saucers, and fire-pans, and
            the golden hinges both for

            the folding doors of the inner shrine or most sacred Place and for the folding doors of the temple]]. <verse eID="1Kgs.7.50"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.7.51" osisID="1Kgs.7.51"/> So all the work pre­pared bv king Solomon in the temple of the
            Eternal was finished; Solomon then brought in the votive offerings of his father David, the silver and the
            gold and the various articles, placing them in the store-chambers of the Eternal's temple. <verse eID="1Kgs.7.51"/>

           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.1" osisID="1Kgs.8.1"/> Then Solomon called together the sheikhs of Israel and all the chiefs of the
            clans, the heads of the various Israelite families, in Jerusalem, to bring the ark of the Eternal's compact up from
            David’s burg. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.1"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.2" osisID="1Kgs.8.2"/> The Israelites all gathered round Solomon at the festival in the month of
            Ethanim (the seventh month); <verse eID="1Kgs.8.2"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.3" osisID="1Kgs.8.3"/> the sheikhs of Israel all went with the priests and <verse eID="1Kgs.8.3"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.4" osisID="1Kgs.8.4"/> carried up the ark of the Eternal, the Trysting tent, and all the sacred
            articles inside the tent; these were carried by the priests and Levites, <verse eID="1Kgs.8.4"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.5" osisID="1Kgs.8.5"/> while king Solomon and all the community of Israel which had gathered round
            him walked in front of the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen past all counting and numbering. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.5"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.6" osisID="1Kgs.8.6"/> The priests placed the ark of the Eternal inside the inner shrine, the most
            sacred interior, under the wings of the kherubs; <verse eID="1Kgs.8.6"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.7" osisID="1Kgs.8.7"/> for the wings of the kherubs stretched over the place for the ark, covering
            the ark and its poles, <verse eID="1Kgs.8.7"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.8" osisID="1Kgs.8.8"/> though the poles were so long that their projecting tips could be seen, not
            outside, but from the sacred hall in front of the shrine--the position they occupy to this very day. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.8"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.9" osisID="1Kgs.8.9"/> Inside the ark there was nothing except the two stone tablets which Moses had
            placed there at Horeb, the tablets of the compact which the Eternal made with the Israelites when they left the land
            of Egypt. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.9"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.10" osisID="1Kgs.8.10"/> When the priests came out of the inner shrine, a cloud filled the temple of
            the Eternal <verse eID="1Kgs.8.10"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.11" osisID="1Kgs.8.11"/> so densely that the priests could not stand to serve; the Eternal's
            splendour of glory filled the temple of the Eternal. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.11"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.12" osisID="1Kgs.8.12"/> Then said Solomon:
            <q><lg>
             <li> The sun has the Eternal set in heaven, </li>
             <li> but chosen himself to dwell in darkness; </li>
           <verse eID="1Kgs.8.12"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.13" osisID="1Kgs.8.13"/>
                <li> so I have built this mansion great for thee, </li>
                <li> for thee to dwell in, to eternity. </li>

       </p>
       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.14" osisID="1Kgs.8.14"/> Then the king turned round and blessed all the gathering of Israel as they

           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.15" osisID="1Kgs.8.15"/> He said, <q>Blessed be the Eternal the God of Israel, who spoke directly to

           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.16" osisID="1Kgs.8.16"/> He said, <q>Ever since I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no

           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.17" osisID="1Kgs.8.17"/> My father David did have it in mind to build a temple in honour of the

           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.18" osisID="1Kgs.8.18"/> but the Eternal said to my father David, <q>You had it in your mind to
            build a temple in my honour; you did well to have that in mind. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.18"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.19" osisID="1Kgs.8.19"/> Yet you are not to build the temple; it is your son, born of your body,

           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.20" osisID="1Kgs.8.20"/> The Eternal has done what he promised; for I have risen to succeed my
            father David and to sit upon the throne of Israel, as the Eternal promised, and I have built the temple in honour
            of the Eternal the God of Israel; <verse eID="1Kgs.8.20"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.21" osisID="1Kgs.8.21"/> in it have I made a place for the ark containing the compact which the

       </p>
       <p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.22" osisID="1Kgs.8.22"/> Then Solomon stood in front of the altar of the Eternal, in presence of all
            the community of Israel, and stretching out his hands to heaven <verse eID="1Kgs.8.22"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.23" osisID="1Kgs.8.23"/> he cried: <q>O Eternal, God of Israel, there is no god like thee in heaven

           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.24" osisID="1Kgs.8.24"/> Thou hast kept thy word to thy servant David my father; thou didst make him

           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.25" osisID="1Kgs.8.25"/> Now then, O Eternal, God of Israel, keep this thy promise to thy servant
            David my father: <q>You shall never lack a descendant in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel, if only your

            the Eternal, he rose from his knees before the altar of the Eternal, where he had been stretching his hands out to
            heaven; <verse eID="1Kgs.8.54"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.55" osisID="1Kgs.8.55"/> he now stood up and in a loud voice blessed all the community of Israel,
            saying, <verse eID="1Kgs.8.55"/>
       </p>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.56" osisID="1Kgs.8.56"/> <q>Blessed be the Eternal who has granted rest to his people Israel, as he
            promised; not a word has failed of all the good promises he made to us by Moses his servant. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.56"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.57" osisID="1Kgs.8.57"/> May the Eternal our God be with us, as he was with our fathers--never
            leaving us, never forsaking us-- <verse eID="1Kgs.8.57"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.58" osisID="1Kgs.8.58"/> that he may move our minds always to live as he lives, to obey his orders,
            his rules and regulations, which he laid down for our fathers! <verse eID="1Kgs.8.58"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.59" osisID="1Kgs.8.59"/> And may these words of my supplication to the Eternal be ever present to
            the Eternal our God, day and night, that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel,
            as each day may require, <verse eID="1Kgs.8.59"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.60" osisID="1Kgs.8.60"/> so that all the nations of the world may learn that the Eternal is God,
            the Eternal and none else. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.60"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.61" osisID="1Kgs.8.61"/> Keep, then, an undivided mind for the Eternal our God, to live by his rules
            and to obey his orders, as to-day.</q> <verse eID="1Kgs.8.61"/>

           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.62" osisID="1Kgs.8.62"/> The king, along with all Israel, offered sacrifices before the Eternal.
           <verse eID="1Kgs.8.62"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.63" osisID="1Kgs.8.63"/> Solomon offered, in his sacrifice of recompense-offering to the Eternal,
            twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep; <verse eID="1Kgs.8.63"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.64" osisID="1Kgs.8.64"/> in this way the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the
            Eternal. The king consecrated that day the middle part of the court in front of the temple of the Eternal; for it
            was there that he sacrificed the victims for the burnt-offering, and offered the cereal-offering and the fat slices
            from the victims of the recompense-offerings, the bronze altar before the Eternal being too small to hold the
            burnt-offering, the cereal-offering, and the fat slices from the victims. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.64"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.65" osisID="1Kgs.8.65"/> Such was the festival then held in presence of the Eternal our God for
            seven days by Solomon and all Israel--a vast host, drawn from all parts, from the pass of Hamath down to the
            Wady-el-Arish. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.65"/>
           <verse sID="1Kgs.8.66" osisID="1Kgs.8.66"/> On the eighth day he dismissed the people, who blessed the king and went
            home rejoicing, glad in heart at all the goodness of the Eternal to his servant David and his people Israel. <verse eID="1Kgs.8.66"/>
