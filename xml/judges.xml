     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.1" osisID="Judg.1.1"/>After Joshua died, the Israel­ites asked the Eternal which of them was to march up
       first and attack the Canaanites. <verse eID="Judg.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.2" osisID="Judg.1.2"/> The Eternal answered, <q>Judah is to march up; I hand over the country to him.</q>
      <verse eID="Judg.1.2"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.3" osisID="Judg.1.3"/> So Judah said to his brother Simeon, <q>March with me into my allotted terri­tory,
       to attack the Canaanites, and then I will march with you into your allotted territory.</q> Simeon accompanied him <verse eID="Judg.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.4" osisID="Judg.1.4"/> [[and, when Judah marched up, the Eternal handed over to them the Canaanites and
       the Perizzites; they defeated ten thousand of them at Bezek]]. <verse eID="Judg.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.5" osisID="Judg.1.5"/> At Bezek they came upon Adoni-bezek and attacked him, defeat­ing the Canaanites and
       the Perizzites. <verse eID="Judg.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.6" osisID="Judg.1.6"/> Adonibezek fled, but they pursued him, cap­tured him, and lopped off his thumbs and
       his great toes. <verse eID="Judg.1.6"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.7" osisID="Judg.1.7"/><q>Seventy chiefs, with their thumbs and great toes lopped off, used to pick up their
       food under my table,</q> said Adoni­bezek; <q>as I did, so has God done to me in turn.</q> He was carried off to Jerusalem,
       and there he died. <verse eID="Judg.1.7"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.19" osisID="Judg.1.19"/> The Eternal was with the Judahites; they gained posses­sion of the highlands,
       although they were unable to evict the dwellers in the plain, who had iron chariots. <verse eID="Judg.1.19"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.21" osisID="Judg.1.21"/> Neither did the men of Judah evict the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; the
       Jebusites lived among the men of Judah as they do to this day in Jerusalem. <verse eID="Judg.1.21"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.8" osisID="Judg.1.8"/> [[The men of Judah attacked and captured Jerusalem, giving no quarter and burning
       up the town. <verse eID="Judg.1.8"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.9" osisID="Judg.1.9"/> After that, the men of Judah marched off to attack the Canaanites who lived in the
       highlands, the Negeb, and the lowlands. <verse eID="Judg.1.9"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.10" osisID="Judg.1.10"/> Judah marched against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (formerly called
       Kiriath-arba); they vanquished Sheshai, Ahiman, and TalmaiJ] <verse eID="Judg.1.10"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.11" osisID="Judg.1.11"/> Then they marched against the natives of Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher).
      <verse eID="Judg.1.11"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.12" osisID="Judg.1.12"/> Caleb declared, <q>Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give
       him my daughter Achsah in marriage.</q> <verse eID="Judg.1.12"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.13" osisID="Judg.1.13"/> Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz, captured it. So Caleb gave
       him his daughter Achsah in marriage. <verse eID="Judg.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.14" osisID="Judg.1.14"/> When she arrived, Othniel induced her to ask her father for a tract of land as
       her dowry; so she alighted from her ass, and, when Caleb asked her what she wanted, <verse eID="Judg.1.14"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.15" osisID="Judg.1.15"/> she said to him, <q>Give me a parting present; as you have settled me in the dry
       south country, let me have some springs of water.</q> Then Caleb gave her the up­per springs and the lower springs. <verse eID="Judg.1.15"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.16" osisID="Judg.1.16"/> When Hobab the Kenite, the father-in-law of Moses, left Palmtown to accompany
       the men of Judah into the desert of Judah near Arad, he went on to settle among the Amalekites. <verse eID="Judg.1.16"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.17" osisID="Judg.1.17"/> But Judah accompanied his brother Simeon; they defeated the Canaanites who
       inhabited Zephath, and massacred them. So the place came to be called Sacredtown (Hormah). <verse eID="Judg.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.18" osisID="Judg.1.18"/> Judah also captured Gaza and its terri­tory, Ashkelon and its terri­tory and Ekron
       and its terri­tory; <verse eID="Judg.1.18"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.20" osisID="Judg.1.20"/> Hebron they assigned to Caleb, as Moses had ordered,
       <milestone type="pb" n="272"/>
       and Caleb ejected from it the three giants. <verse eID="Judg.1.20"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.22" osisID="Judg.1.22"/> The clansmen of Joseph marched also against Bethel. The Eternal was with them.
      <verse eID="Judg.1.22"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.23" osisID="Judg.1.23"/> When the clansmen of Joseph sent men to reconnoitre at Bethel (formerly called
       Luz), <verse eID="Judg.1.23"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.24" osisID="Judg.1.24"/> the scouts saw a man leaving the town and caught him; <q>Come, tell us,</q> they
       said, <q>how to get into the town, and we will treat you well.</q> <verse eID="Judg.1.24"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.25" osisID="Judg.1.25"/> So he showed them how to get into the town, and they stormed it, giving no
       quarter; they let the man and his family go free, <verse eID="Judg.1.25"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.26" osisID="Judg.1.26"/> and he went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a town, calling it Luz.
       That is its name to this day. <verse eID="Judg.1.26"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.27" osisID="Judg.1.27"/> Manasseh did not gain pos­session of Beth-shean and its townships, nor of Taanak
       and its townships; they did not evict the inhabitants of Dor and its townships, nor of Ibleam and its townships, nor of
       Megiddo and its townships. The Canaanites clung to this country. <verse eID="Judg.1.27"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.28" osisID="Judg.1.28"/> When Israel became a power, they forced the Canaanites to slave for them, but
       they never evicted them entirely. <verse eID="Judg.1.28"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.29" osisID="Judg.1.29"/> Eph­raim did not evict the Canaan­ites who lived at Gezer; the Canaanites lived
       among them in Gezer. <verse eID="Judg.1.29"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.30" osisID="Judg.1.30"/> Zebulun did not evict the inhabitants of Kitron or of Nahalal; the Canaanites
       lived among them and were turned into labour-gangs. <verse eID="Judg.1.30"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.31" osisID="Judg.1.31"/> Asher did not evict the inhabitants of Acco or of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib
       or of Helbah or of Aphek or of Rehob; <verse eID="Judg.1.31"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.32" osisID="Judg.1.32"/> the Asherites lived among the native Canaanites, who could not be evicted. <verse eID="Judg.1.32"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.33" osisID="Judg.1.33"/> Naphtali did not evict the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh or of Beth-anath, but
       lived among the native Canaanites. The inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath, however, were turned into labour-gangs.
      <verse eID="Judg.1.33"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.34" osisID="Judg.1.34"/> As for the Danites, they were forced into the highlands by the Amorites, who
       would not allow them down into the plain. <verse eID="Judg.1.34"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.35" osisID="Judg.1.35"/> The Amorites clung to Harheres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim; but, as the clans­men of
       Joseph prevailed in pow­er, they were turned into labour-gangs. <verse eID="Judg.1.35"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.36" osisID="Judg.1.36"/> [[The frontier of the Edomites ran from the Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond
       it.]] <verse eID="Judg.1.36"/>
