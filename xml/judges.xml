     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.1" osisID="Judg.1.1"/>After Joshua died, the Israel­ites asked the Eternal which of them was to march up
       first and attack the Canaanites. <verse eID="Judg.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.2" osisID="Judg.1.2"/> The Eternal answered, <q>Judah is to march up; I hand over the country to him.</q>
      <verse eID="Judg.1.2"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.3" osisID="Judg.1.3"/> So Judah said to his brother Simeon, <q>March with me into my allotted terri­tory,
       to attack the Canaanites, and then I will march with you into your allotted territory.</q> Simeon accompanied him <verse eID="Judg.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.4" osisID="Judg.1.4"/> [[and, when Judah marched up, the Eternal handed over to them the Canaanites and
       the Perizzites; they defeated ten thousand of them at Bezek]]. <verse eID="Judg.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.5" osisID="Judg.1.5"/> At Bezek they came upon Adoni-bezek and attacked him, defeat­ing the Canaanites and
       the Perizzites. <verse eID="Judg.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.6" osisID="Judg.1.6"/> Adonibezek fled, but they pursued him, cap­tured him, and lopped off his thumbs and
       his great toes. <verse eID="Judg.1.6"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.7" osisID="Judg.1.7"/><q>Seventy chiefs, with their thumbs and great toes lopped off, used to pick up their
       food under my table,</q> said Adoni­bezek; <q>as I did, so has God done to me in turn.</q> He was carried off to Jerusalem,
       and there he died. <verse eID="Judg.1.7"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.19" osisID="Judg.1.19"/> The Eternal was with the Judahites; they gained posses­sion of the highlands,
       although they were unable to evict the dwellers in the plain, who had iron chariots. <verse eID="Judg.1.19"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.21" osisID="Judg.1.21"/> Neither did the men of Judah evict the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; the
       Jebusites lived among the men of Judah as they do to this day in Jerusalem. <verse eID="Judg.1.21"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.8" osisID="Judg.1.8"/> [[The men of Judah attacked and captured Jerusalem, giving no quarter and burning
       up the town. <verse eID="Judg.1.8"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.9" osisID="Judg.1.9"/> After that, the men of Judah marched off to attack the Canaanites who lived in the
       highlands, the Negeb, and the lowlands. <verse eID="Judg.1.9"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.10" osisID="Judg.1.10"/> Judah marched against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (formerly called
       Kiriath-arba); they vanquished Sheshai, Ahiman, and TalmaiJ] <verse eID="Judg.1.10"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.11" osisID="Judg.1.11"/> Then they marched against the natives of Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher).
      <verse eID="Judg.1.11"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.12" osisID="Judg.1.12"/> Caleb declared, <q>Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give
       him my daughter Achsah in marriage.</q> <verse eID="Judg.1.12"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.13" osisID="Judg.1.13"/> Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz, captured it. So Caleb gave
       him his daughter Achsah in marriage. <verse eID="Judg.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.14" osisID="Judg.1.14"/> When she arrived, Othniel induced her to ask her father for a tract of land as
       her dowry; so she alighted from her ass, and, when Caleb asked her what she wanted, <verse eID="Judg.1.14"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.15" osisID="Judg.1.15"/> she said to him, <q>Give me a parting present; as you have settled me in the dry
       south country, let me have some springs of water.</q> Then Caleb gave her the up­per springs and the lower springs. <verse eID="Judg.1.15"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.16" osisID="Judg.1.16"/> When Hobab the Kenite, the father-in-law of Moses, left Palmtown to accompany
       the men of Judah into the desert of Judah near Arad, he went on to settle among the Amalekites. <verse eID="Judg.1.16"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.17" osisID="Judg.1.17"/> But Judah accompanied his brother Simeon; they defeated the Canaanites who
       inhabited Zephath, and massacred them. So the place came to be called Sacredtown (Hormah). <verse eID="Judg.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.18" osisID="Judg.1.18"/> Judah also captured Gaza and its terri­tory, Ashkelon and its terri­tory and Ekron
       and its terri­tory; <verse eID="Judg.1.18"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.20" osisID="Judg.1.20"/> Hebron they assigned to Caleb, as Moses had ordered,
       <milestone type="pb" n="272"/>
       and Caleb ejected from it the three giants. <verse eID="Judg.1.20"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.22" osisID="Judg.1.22"/> The clansmen of Joseph marched also against Bethel. The Eternal was with them.
      <verse eID="Judg.1.22"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.23" osisID="Judg.1.23"/> When the clansmen of Joseph sent men to reconnoitre at Bethel (formerly called
       Luz), <verse eID="Judg.1.23"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.24" osisID="Judg.1.24"/> the scouts saw a man leaving the town and caught him; <q>Come, tell us,</q> they
       said, <q>how to get into the town, and we will treat you well.</q> <verse eID="Judg.1.24"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.25" osisID="Judg.1.25"/> So he showed them how to get into the town, and they stormed it, giving no
       quarter; they let the man and his family go free, <verse eID="Judg.1.25"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.26" osisID="Judg.1.26"/> and he went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a town, calling it Luz.
       That is its name to this day. <verse eID="Judg.1.26"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.27" osisID="Judg.1.27"/> Manasseh did not gain pos­session of Beth-shean and its townships, nor of Taanak
       and its townships; they did not evict the inhabitants of Dor and its townships, nor of Ibleam and its townships, nor of
       Megiddo and its townships. The Canaanites clung to this country. <verse eID="Judg.1.27"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.28" osisID="Judg.1.28"/> When Israel became a power, they forced the Canaanites to slave for them, but
       they never evicted them entirely. <verse eID="Judg.1.28"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.29" osisID="Judg.1.29"/> Eph­raim did not evict the Canaan­ites who lived at Gezer; the Canaanites lived
       among them in Gezer. <verse eID="Judg.1.29"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.30" osisID="Judg.1.30"/> Zebulun did not evict the inhabitants of Kitron or of Nahalal; the Canaanites
       lived among them and were turned into labour-gangs. <verse eID="Judg.1.30"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.31" osisID="Judg.1.31"/> Asher did not evict the inhabitants of Acco or of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib
       or of Helbah or of Aphek or of Rehob; <verse eID="Judg.1.31"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.32" osisID="Judg.1.32"/> the Asherites lived among the native Canaanites, who could not be evicted. <verse eID="Judg.1.32"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.33" osisID="Judg.1.33"/> Naphtali did not evict the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh or of Beth-anath, but
       lived among the native Canaanites. The inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath, however, were turned into labour-gangs.
      <verse eID="Judg.1.33"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.34" osisID="Judg.1.34"/> As for the Danites, they were forced into the highlands by the Amorites, who
       would not allow them down into the plain. <verse eID="Judg.1.34"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.35" osisID="Judg.1.35"/> The Amorites clung to Harheres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim; but, as the clans­men of
       Joseph prevailed in pow­er, they were turned into labour-gangs. <verse eID="Judg.1.35"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.1.36" osisID="Judg.1.36"/> [[The frontier of the Edomites ran from the Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond
       it.]] <verse eID="Judg.1.36"/>

    <chapter eID="Judg.1"/>
    <chapter osisID="Judg.2" sID="Judg.2"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.1" osisID="Judg.2.1"/>Then the angel of the Eternal went from Gilgal up to Bethel, and said: <q>...I
       brought you out of Egypt into the land I swore to your fathers that I would give to you. I said that I would never break
       my compact with you, <verse eID="Judg.2.1"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.2" osisID="Judg.2.2"/> and that you must never make terms with the natives--you must pull down their
       altars. But you have not obeyed my orders. What is this you have done? <verse eID="Judg.2.2"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.3" osisID="Judg.2.3"/> So I add this word: <q>I will not dispossess them to make room for you: they shall
       be a scourge on your flanks, and their gods shall prove a danger to you.</q> <verse eID="Judg.2.3"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.4" osisID="Judg.2.4"/> When the angel of the Eternal said this to all the Israelites, the people burst
       into loud weeping. <verse eID="Judg.2.4"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.5" osisID="Judg.2.5"/> They called the place Bochim (or Weepers), and there they sacrificed to the
       Eternal.</q><verse eID="Judg.2.5"/>
     </p>
     <p> * * * * </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.6" osisID="Judg.2.6"/> When Joshua dismissed the people, the Israelites went back, each to his own
       property, to take possession of the country. <verse eID="Judg.2.6"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.7" osisID="Judg.2.7"/> During all the lifetime of Joshua and of the sheikhs who survived Joshua, who had
       seen all the great work done by the Eternal for Israel, the people continued to serve the Eternal. <verse eID="Judg.2.7"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.8" osisID="Judg.2.8"/> At the 8 age of a hundred and ten Joshua
       <milestone type="pb" n="273"/>
       the son of Nun, the servant of the Eternal, died. <verse eID="Judg.2.8"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.9" osisID="Judg.2.9"/> They buried him on his estate at Timnath-heres in the highlands of Eph­raim, north
       of mount Gaash. <verse eID="Judg.2.9"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.10" osisID="Judg.2.10"/> Then all that generation was gathered to their fathers, and another generation
       arose who knew nothing about the Eternal or the work he had done for Israel. <verse eID="Judg.2.10"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.11" osisID="Judg.2.11"/> These Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Eternal, serving the
       Baals <verse eID="Judg.2.11"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.12" osisID="Judg.2.12"/> and forsaking the Eternal, the God of their fathers, who had brought them from
       the land of Egypt, running after other gods belonging to the gods of the nations around, and bowing down to them; <verse eID="Judg.2.12"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.13" osisID="Judg.2.13"/> they vexed the Eternal by forsaking the Eternal and sacrificing to Baal and
       Astarte. <verse eID="Judg.2.13"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.14" osisID="Judg.2.14"/> So the anger of the Eternal blazed against Israel; he handed them over to
       plun­derers who plundered them, he sold them into the power of their enemies around, till they could no longer hold their
       own against their enemies; <verse eID="Judg.2.14"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.15" osisID="Judg.2.15"/> wherever they marched, the Eternal’s hand was against them for evil, as the
       Eternal had threatened and sworn. They were in a sore plight. <verse eID="Judg.2.15"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.16" osisID="Judg.2.16"/> The Eternal raised up heroes, who rescued them from their plunderers; <verse eID="Judg.2.16"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.17" osisID="Judg.2.17"/> but they would not listen even to their heroes. Faithlessly they went after
       other gods, bowing down to them; they soon swerved from the line of their fathers who obeyed the com­mands of the
       Eternal--which was not what they did. <verse eID="Judg.2.17"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.18" osisID="Judg.2.18"/> When the Eternal raised up heroes for them, the Eternal would be with the
       heroes and rescue them from the power of their enemies dur­ing all the days of the hero; for the Eternal was moved to pity
       by their groans under the grip of their tyrants and oppressors. <verse eID="Judg.2.18"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.19" osisID="Judg.2.19"/> But whenever the hero died, they would relapse and behave worse than ever,
       running after other gods, sacrificing to them and bowing before them; they would not drop any of their practices or
       stubborn ways. <verse eID="Judg.2.19"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.20" osisID="Judg.2.20"/> So the anger of the Eternal blazed against Israel; he said, <q>As this nation
       has violated the compact which I enjoined upon their fathers and has not listened to my orders, <verse eID="Judg.2.20"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.21" osisID="Judg.2.21"/> I will no longer evict for them any of the nations that Joshua left when he
       died</q><verse eID="Judg.2.21"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.22" osisID="Judg.2.22"/>--His aim being to test Israel by means of them, to see whether or not they would
       live by the rules of the Eternal as their fathers did. <verse eID="Judg.2.22"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.2.23" osisID="Judg.2.23"/> So the Eternal left these nations, in­stead of evicting them all at once[[; he
       did not hand them over to Joshua]]. <verse eID="Judg.2.23"/>
     </p>
    <chapter eID="Judg.2"/>
    <chapter osisID="Judg.3" sID="Judg.3"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.1" osisID="Judg.3.1"/>The following are the nations left by the Eternal as a test for all the Israelites
       who had had no experience of the war of invasion in Canaan--<verse eID="Judg.3.1"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.2" osisID="Judg.3.2"/>simply for giving lessons in war­fare to these generations of Israelites who
       hitherto knew nothing about fighting; <verse eID="Judg.3.2"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.3" osisID="Judg.3.3"/> there were the five tyrants of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the
       Phoenicians, and the Hittites of mount Lebanon, stretch­ing from mount Baal-hermon to the pass of Hamath. <verse eID="Judg.3.3"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.4" osisID="Judg.3.4"/> They served as a test, to show whether Israel would obey what the Eternal had
       commanded their fathers through Moses. <verse eID="Judg.3.4"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.5" osisID="Judg.3.5"/> As the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the
       Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites,
      <verse eID="Judg.3.5"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.6" osisID="Judg.3.6"/> they married their daughters,
       <milestone type="pb" n="274"/>
       married their own daughters to their sons, and sacrificed to their gods. <verse eID="Judg.3.6"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.7" osisID="Judg.3.7"/> The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Eternal, forgetting the
       Eternal their own God and worshipping the Baals and sacred poles. <verse eID="Judg.3.7"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.8" osisID="Judg.3.8"/> So the anger of the Eternal flamed hot against Israel; he sold them into the
       power of Kushan-rishathaim the king of Mesopo­tamia, and for eight years the Israelites were subject to Kushan-rishathaim.
      <verse eID="Judg.3.8"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.9" osisID="Judg.3.9"/> Then the Israelites cried to the Eternal, and the Eternal raised up a champion for
       the Israelites, who rescued them; it was Othniel, the son of Caleb’s younger brother, Kenaz. <verse eID="Judg.3.9"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.10" osisID="Judg.3.10"/> The spirit of the Eternal in­spired him; he avenged Israel. When he marched out
       to battle, the Eternal handed over to him Kushan-rishathaim the king of Mesopotamia, till he got the upper hand of
       Kushan-rishathaim. <verse eID="Judg.3.10"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.11" osisID="Judg.3.11"/> For forty years the land lay safe. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died, <verse eID="Judg.3.11"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.12" osisID="Judg.3.12"/> and again the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Eternal. So the
       Eternal made Eglon the king of Moab gain the upper hand over Israel, since they had done what was evil in the sight of the
       Eternal. <verse eID="Judg.3.12"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.13" osisID="Judg.3.13"/> Eglon, collecting the Ammonites and the Amalekites, went and defeated Israel,
       seizing Palmtown; <verse eID="Judg.3.13"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.14" osisID="Judg.3.14"/> and for eighteen years the Israelites were subject to Eglon the king of Moab.
      <verse eID="Judg.3.14"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.15" osisID="Judg.3.15"/> Then Israel cried to the Eternal, and the Eternal raised up a champion for them;
       it was Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite who was left-handed. He carried tribute from the Israel­ites to Eglon the king of
       Moab. <verse eID="Judg.3.15"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.16" osisID="Judg.3.16"/> On his right thigh under his clothes, Ehud hung a dirk which he had made, a
       two-edged weapon eighteen inches long. <verse eID="Judg.3.16"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.17" osisID="Judg.3.17"/> He presented the tribute to Eglon the king of Moab (Eglon was a very fat man),
      <verse eID="Judg.3.17"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.18" osisID="Judg.3.18"/> and when he had finished presenting the tribute, he dismissed the car­riers.
      <verse eID="Judg.3.18"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.19" osisID="Judg.3.19"/> He himself halted at the sculptured stones near Gilgal, and went back, saying,
       <q>I have a private message for you, O king.</q> <q>Silence!</q> said Eglon to his attendants, and they all left him. <verse eID="Judg.3.19"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.20" osisID="Judg.3.20"/> Then Ehud went in to see him, as he sat alone in his cool upper room. <q>I have
       a message from God for you,</q> said Ehud. As Eglon rose from his chair, <verse eID="Judg.3.20"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.21" osisID="Judg.3.21"/> Ehud put out his left hand, drew the dirk from his right thigh, and drove it
       into his belly; <verse eID="Judg.3.21"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.22" osisID="Judg.3.22"/> the hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did
       not draw the dirk out of his belly. <verse eID="Judg.3.22"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.23" osisID="Judg.3.23"/> Ehud then went out into the vestibule, shutting the doors of the room and
       locking Eglon in. <verse eID="Judg.3.23"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.24" osisID="Judg.3.24"/> After he had gone, the king’s servants came; they saw that the doors of the
       upper room were locked, but they thought that he must be relieving him­self in the closet of the upper chamber. <verse eID="Judg.3.24"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.25" osisID="Judg.3.25"/> They waited, till they were at their wits' end. As he did not open the doors of
       the upper room, they opened them with a key--and there lay their lord dead on the floor! <verse eID="Judg.3.25"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.26" osisID="Judg.3.26"/> Meantime, as they were waiting, Ehud had escaped, past the sculptured stones,
       safe to Seirah. <verse eID="Judg.3.26"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.27" osisID="Judg.3.27"/> When he got there, he sounded the alarm through the high­lands of Ephraim, and
       the Is­raelites accompanied him from the highlands as their leader. <verse eID="Judg.3.27"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.28" osisID="Judg.3.28"/> <q>Follow me down,</q> he cried, <q>the Eternal has handed you over your enemies
       in Moab!</q> So they marched after him and
       <milestone type="pb" n="275"/>
       seized the fords of the Jordan, preventing any Moabite from crossing. <verse eID="Judg.3.28"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.29" osisID="Judg.3.29"/> They slew that day about ten thousand Moabites, stout warriors, all of them;
       not a man escaped. <verse eID="Judg.3.29"/>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.30" osisID="Judg.3.30"/> Moab was subdued that day by Israel, and for eighty years the land lay safe. <verse eID="Judg.3.30"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Judg.3.31" osisID="Judg.3.31"/> After him came Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred Philistines with
       an ox-goad; he also rescued Israel. <verse eID="Judg.3.31"/>
