     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.1" osisID="Josh.1.1"/>Now, after the death of Moses the servant of the Eter­nal, the Eternal said to
       Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses,
      <verse eID="Josh.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.2" osisID="Josh.1.2"/>
       <q>Moses my servant is dead; come, cross the Jordan here, you and all this people, into the land which I assign to them,
       to the Israelites. <verse eID="Josh.1.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.3" osisID="Josh.1.3"/> Every foot of ground you tread I assign to you, as I promised Moses; <verse eID="Josh.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.4" osisID="Josh.1.4"/> your frontier shall stretch from the desert to Leb­anon yonder, from the great
       River, the river Euphrates, over all the land of the Hittites, to the great Mediterranean Sea westward. <verse eID="Josh.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.5" osisID="Josh.1.5"/> Not a man shall be able to hold his own against you all the days of your life;
       as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never fail you nor forsake you. <verse eID="Josh.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.6" osisID="Josh.1.6"/> Be strong, be brave, for you shall put this people in possession of the land
       which I swore to their fathers that I would give them. <verse eID="Josh.1.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.7" osisID="Josh.1.7"/> Only be strong and brave, mindful to carry out all your orders from my servant
       Moses, turning neither to the right nor to the left, so that you may succeed wherever you go. <verse eID="Josh.1.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.8" osisID="Josh.1.8"/> This law­book you shall never cease to have on your lips; you must pore over it
       day and night, that you may be mindful to carry out all that is written in it, for so shall you make your way prosperous,
       so shall you succeed. <verse eID="Josh.1.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.9" osisID="Josh.1.9"/> These are my orders: be firm and brave, never be daunted or dismayed, for the
       Eternal your God is with you wherever you go.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.1.9"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.10" osisID="Josh.1.10"/> Then Joshua ordered the officers of the nation <verse eID="Josh.1.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.11" osisID="Josh.1.11"/> to go through the camp and com­mand the people to <q>Prepare food, for within
       three days you are going to cross the Jordan here and enter into possession of the land which the Eternal your God assigns
       you for your very own.</q> <verse eID="Josh.1.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.12" osisID="Josh.1.12"/> Joshua also said to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-clan of
       Manasseh, <verse eID="Josh.1.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.13" osisID="Josh.1.13"/> <q>Remember what Moses the servant of the Eternal com­manded you when he told
       you that the Eternal your God would settle you here and give you this region. <verse eID="Josh.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.14" osisID="Josh.1.14"/> Your wives, your children, and your cattle shall re­main in this land which
       Moses assigned you east of the Jordan, but you must march across un­der arms in front of your kins­men, every fighting man
       among you, to assist them, <verse eID="Josh.1.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.15" osisID="Josh.1.15"/> till the Eternal settles your kinsmen like yourselves, till they get posses­sion
       of the land which the Eter­nal your God assigns to them; then you may return to your own region and occupy the land
       assigned you by Moses the servant of the Eternal on the eastern bank of the Jordan.</q> <verse eID="Josh.1.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.16" osisID="Josh.1.16"/> They answered Joshua, <q>Whatever you command us we will do, and wherever you
       send us we will go. <verse eID="Josh.1.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.17" osisID="Josh.1.17"/> As we obeyed Moses in everything, so we will obey you; only may the Eternal
       your God be with you as he was with Moses! <verse eID="Josh.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.18" osisID="Josh.1.18"/> Whoever rebels against your orders and will not listen to what you say by way
       of command to him, that man shall be put to death. Only be firm and brave.</q> <verse eID="Josh.1.18"/>

     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.1" osisID="Josh.2.1"/> From Shittim Joshua sent two men secretly as spies to explore the country and
       <milestone type="pb" n="243"/>
       specially Jericho. When they ar­rived, they went into the house of a harlot called Rahab and stayed there. <verse eID="Josh.2.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.2" osisID="Josh.2.2"/> The king of Jericho was told that two men of Israel had come in that night to
       find out about the country; <verse eID="Josh.2.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.3" osisID="Josh.2.3"/> so he sent a message to Rahab to <q>Bring out the two men who have come to you,
       who have entered your house, for they are here to find out all about the country.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.4" osisID="Josh.2.4"/> The woman, who had taken the men and hid them, said, <q>Yes, the men did come to
       me, but I did not know where they came from, <verse eID="Josh.2.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.5" osisID="Josh.2.5"/> and just about the hour for shutting the town-gate, when it was dark, the men
       went off. Where they went, I do not know. Quick, pursue them, for you will overtake them.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.6" osisID="Josh.2.6"/> Now she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax
       which she had arranged on the roof. <verse eID="Josh.2.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.7" osisID="Josh.2.7"/> The pursuers went by the road to the Jordan, as far as the fords, and as soon as
       they left the town the gate was shut. <verse eID="Josh.2.7"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.8" osisID="Josh.2.8"/> The two men had not lain down, before the woman came to them on the roof <verse eID="Josh.2.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.9" osisID="Josh.2.9"/> and said, <q>I know that the Eternal has given you this country, and how the
       terror of you has fallen upon us, till all the natives are quivering before you. <verse eID="Josh.2.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.10" osisID="Josh.2.10"/> For we have heard how the Eternal dried up the water of the Reed Sea before
       you, when you left Egypt, and how you treated the two Amorite kings on the east of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you
       wiped off the earth. <verse eID="Josh.2.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.11" osisID="Josh.2.11"/> As soon as we heard it, our hearts quivered and everyone became utterly
       dispirited be­cause of you, for the Eternal your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. <verse eID="Josh.2.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.12" osisID="Josh.2.12"/> Now then, since I have dealt kindly with you, pray swear to me by the Eternal
       that you will deal kindly with my family, and give me a sure sign of it; <verse eID="Josh.2.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.13" osisID="Josh.2.13"/> swear that you will spare the lives of my father and my mother and my brothers
       and my sisters and all they have, saving us from death.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.14" osisID="Josh.2.14"/> The men re­plied, <q>Our lives for yours--only you must not breathe a word
       about our errand; then we will deal kindly and honestly with you when the Eternal gives us the country.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.17" osisID="Josh.2.17"/> The men told her, The men told her, <q>We will not be bound by this oath to
       you, which you have made us swear, <verse eID="Josh.2.17"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.18" osisID="Josh.2.18"/> unless, when we enter the country, you tie this cord of scarlet thread outside
       the win­dow through which you let us down. You must gather your father and mother and brothers and all your family
       inside your house; <verse eID="Josh.2.18"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.19" osisID="Josh.2.19"/> anyone who crosses the door of your house into the street, his blood be on his
       own head, we are not to blame; but if a hand is laid on anyone in­side the house, then his blood be on our head! <verse eID="Josh.2.19"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.20" osisID="Josh.2.20"/> But remember, if you breathe a word about our errand, we will not be bound by
       the oath you have made us swear.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.20"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.21" osisID="Josh.2.21"/> <q>As you say,</q> answered the woman, <q>so be it.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.2.21"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.15" osisID="Josh.2.15"/> Then she lowered them by a rope out of the window, for her house was on the
       town-wall; she stayed on the town-wall. <verse eID="Josh.2.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.16" osisID="Josh.2.16"/> She told them, <q>Get away to the hills, lest the pursuers come across you;
       hide yourselves there for three days till the pur­suers return, and then make your retreat.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.2.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.21" osisID="Josh.2.21"/> So away they went, while she tied the scarlet cord to the window. <verse eID="Josh.2.21"/>
      <milestone type="pb" n="243"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.22" osisID="Josh.2.22"/> They went into the hills and stayed there for three days, till the pursuers
       returned (the pur­suers looked for them all along the road and could not find them). <verse eID="Josh.2.22"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.23" osisID="Josh.2.23"/> Then the two men came down from the hills and crossed over to Joshua the son
       of Nun, telling him all that had befallen them; <verse eID="Josh.2.23"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.24" osisID="Josh.2.24"/> they said to Joshua, <q>The Eternal has put all the country into our hands.
       The natives are all quivering before us!</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.24"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.3" sID="Josh.3"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.1" osisID="Josh.3.1"/>In the morning Joshua rose; he and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and
       reached the Jordan, where they passed the night before they crossed over. <verse eID="Josh.3.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.2" osisID="Josh.3.2"/> Three days afterwards the officers went through the camp <verse eID="Josh.3.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.3" osisID="Josh.3.3"/> and gave this order to the nation: <q>When you see the ark of the compact of the
       Eter­nal your God being carried by the priestly Levites, then set out and follow it, <verse eID="Josh.3.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.4" osisID="Josh.3.4"/> so that you may learn the ford by which you are to cross; for you have never
       crossed here before. Only, you must not come close to the ark; between it and you there must be a space kept of one
       thousand yards.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.5" osisID="Josh.3.5"/> Then Joshua said to the people, <q>Consecrate yourselves, for to-morrow the
       Eternal will do wonders among you.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.6" osisID="Josh.3.6"/> To the priests he said, <q>Lift the ark of the compact and go in front of the
       people.</q> So they lifted the ark of the compact and went in front of the people. <verse eID="Josh.3.6"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.7" osisID="Josh.3.7"/> The Eternal said to Joshua, <q>This day I begin to exalt you in the sight of
       Israel, to let them see that as I was with Moses so I will be with you. <verse eID="Josh.3.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.8" osisID="Josh.3.8"/> Order the priests who are carrying the ark of the compact to stand still in the
       Jordan as soon as they reach the edge of the water.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.8"/>
    <chapter eID="Josh.3"/>
    <chapter osisID="Josh.4" sID="Josh.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.1" osisID="Josh.4.1"/> The Eternal also said to Joshua, <verse eID="Josh.4.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.2" osisID="Josh.4.2"/> <q>Take twelve men from the nation, a man from each clan,<verse eID="Josh.4.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.3" osisID="Josh.4.3"/> and order them to take twelve stones out of the Jordan from the spot where the
       feet of the priest stood firm; they must carry these stones across and place them on the spot where you spend the night.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.4.3"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.3" sID="Josh.3"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.9" osisID="Josh.3.9"/> Then Joshua bade the Israelites come and listen to the words of the Eternal,
       their God. <verse eID="Josh.3.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.10" osisID="Josh.3.10"/> Joshua said, <q>This is to let you see that the living God is among you, and
       that he will without fail evict before you the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the
       Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite. <verse eID="Josh.3.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.11" osisID="Josh.3.11"/> See, the ark of the compact of the Lord of all the earth is crossing the
       Jordan in front of you. <verse eID="Josh.3.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.12" osisID="Josh.3.12"/> Now choose twelve men from the clans of Israel, a man from each clan. <verse eID="Josh.3.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.13" osisID="Josh.3.13"/> As soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the
       compact of the Eternal, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the water of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be
       stopped; the waters which are flowing down, they shall be dammed up.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.14" osisID="Josh.3.14"/> When the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, headed by the priests
       who carried the ark of the compact, <verse eID="Josh.3.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.15" osisID="Josh.3.15"/> as soon as the bearers reached the Jordan and the feet of the priests dipped
       in the water at the edge (for the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest), <verse eID="Josh.3.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.16" osisID="Josh.3.16"/> the waters that flow down stopped and were dammed up at a distance, at Adamah
       (a town beside Zartan), while the waters that flow away to the sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) were cut off and
       <milestone type="pb" n="244"/>
       failed. In this way the people crossed, opposite Jericho. <verse eID="Josh.3.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.17" osisID="Josh.3.17"/> The priests who carried the ark of the compact of the Eternal stood still on
       dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, and all Israel crossed on dry ground until the whole nation had finished
       crossing. <verse eID="Josh.3.17"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.4" sID="Josh.4"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.1" osisID="Josh.4.1"/>When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan,<verse eID="Josh.4.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.4" osisID="Josh.4.4"/> Joshua called the twelve men of Israel whom he had ready, one from each of the
       clans; <verse eID="Josh.4.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.5" osisID="Josh.4.5"/> Joshua said to them, <q>Cross in front of the ark of the Eternal your God
       through the Jordan, each of you taking a stone on his shoulder, one for each of the clans of Israel. <verse eID="Josh.4.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.6" osisID="Josh.4.6"/> They are to be a sign for your nation. When your children in after days ask what
       is the meaning of these stones, <verse eID="Josh.4.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.7" osisID="Josh.4.7"/> you shall tell them it was because the waters of the Jordan were stopped be­fore
       the ark of the compact of the Eternal, stopped when it crossed the Jordan; these stones shall be a memorial for Israel
       for all time.</q> <verse eID="Josh.4.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.8" osisID="Josh.4.8"/> The Israelites did as Joshua gave orders; they lifted twelve stones out of the
       Jordan, as the Eternal had com­manded Joshua, one for each of the clans of Israel, and carried them over along with them
       to the spot where they spent the night, laying them down there. <verse eID="Josh.4.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.9" osisID="Josh.4.9"/> [[Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan on the spot where the
       feet of the priests who carried the ark of the compact had stood; they are there to this day. <verse eID="Josh.4.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.10" osisID="Josh.4.10"/> For the priests who carried the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan till all

       people hurried over, <verse eID="Josh.4.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.11" osisID="Josh.4.11"/> and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark passed over, the
       priests advancing to the front of the people. <verse eID="Josh.4.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.12" osisID="Josh.4.12"/> The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half clan of Manasseh passed across under
       arms in front of the Israelites, as Moses had ordered them, <verse eID="Josh.4.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.13" osisID="Josh.4.13"/> about forty thousand men equipped for war, crossing under the eyes of the
       Eternal to the steppes of Jericho for battle. <verse eID="Josh.4.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.14" osisID="Josh.4.14"/> The Eternal exalted Joshua that day in the eyes of all Israel; they stood in
       awe of him as they had stood in awe of Moses all the days of his life. <verse eID="Josh.4.14"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.15" osisID="Josh.4.15"/> Then the Eternal said to Joshua, <verse eID="Josh.4.15"/>

       from the Jor­dan, when the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted on to the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan

      <verse sID="Josh.4.19" osisID="Josh.4.19"/> It was on the tenth day of the first month that the people came up from the

      <verse sID="Josh.4.20" osisID="Josh.4.20"/> These twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan were set up by Joshua at
       Gilgal. <verse eID="Josh.4.20"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.21" osisID="Josh.4.21"/> He said to the Israelites, <q>When your children in after days ask their

      <verse eID="Josh.4.22"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.23" osisID="Josh.4.23"/> For the Eternal your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you till you

      <verse sID="Josh.5.1" osisID="Josh.5.1"/>Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings by
       the Mediterranean heard how the Eternal had dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the Israelites till they had
       got across, their hearts quivered and they were all dispirited, on account of the Israelites. <verse eID="Josh.5.1"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.2" osisID="Josh.5.2"/> It was then that the Eternal said to Joshua, <q>Make flint knives and
       circumcise the Israelites once more.</q> <verse eID="Josh.5.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.3" osisID="Josh.5.3"/> So Joshua made flint knives and cir­cumcised the Israelites at the Hill of
       Foreskins. <verse eID="Josh.5.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.9" osisID="Josh.5.9"/> Then said the Eternal to Joshua, <q>And now I have rolled off you the scorn of
       the Egyptians.</q> Hence the name of the spot was called Rollstone (Gilgal), and is so called to this day. <verse eID="Josh.5.9"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.4" osisID="Josh.5.4"/> [[Joshua circumcised them for this reason. All who had left Egypt, all the male

      <verse sID="Josh.5.5" osisID="Josh.5.5"/> These who had left Egypt were circumcised, but none of the people who had been

      <verse sID="Josh.5.6" osisID="Josh.5.6"/> For forty years the Israelites had journeyed in the desert until the whole
       nation of war­riors who had left Egypt had perished, because they would not listen to what the Eternal said, and because
       the Eternal had sworn to them that he would not let them see the land which the Eternal had sworn to their fathers that
       he would give to us, a land abounding in milk and honey. <verse eID="Josh.5.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.7" osisID="Josh.5.7"/> So their children, whom the Eternal raised up instead of them, were circum­cised
       by Joshua, since they had never been circumcised from time to time. <verse eID="Josh.5.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.8" osisID="Josh.5.8"/> After the circumcising was over, the whole na­tion remained where they were in

      <verse sID="Josh.6.15" osisID="Josh.6.15"/> On the seventh day they rose at dawn and marched round the town seven times;

      <verse sID="Josh.6.21" osisID="Josh.6.21"/> In they marched and so they took the town, massacring all inside, men and

      <verse sID="Josh.6.23" osisID="Josh.6.23"/> So the young spies went and brought Rahab out, with her

      <verse sID="Josh.6.26" osisID="Josh.6.26"/> Joshua then laid this oath upon the people: <q>Cursed before the Eternal be

     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.7.2" osisID="Josh.7.2"/> Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which lies close to Bethaven on the east of

       for there are few folk at Ai.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.7.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.7.4" osisID="Josh.7.4"/> So about three thousand men marched up; but they ran away from the men of Ai.

      <verse sID="Josh.8.19" osisID="Josh.8.19"/> The men in ambush then came out quickly and hur­ried to set the town on fire,
      <verse eID="Josh.8.19"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.8.20" osisID="Josh.8.20"/> so that when the men of Ai turned round to look, there was smoke rising from
       the town! <verse eID="Josh.8.20"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.8.21" osisID="Josh.8.21"/> They had no chance to flee this way or that, for the pursued turned upon the
       pursuers when they saw the smoke rising from the town, <verse eID="Josh.8.21"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.8.22" osisID="Josh.8.22"/> and the men in ambush rushed from the town to join them, so that the men of Ai
       were caught between Israelites, some on one side and some on the other; they were slaughtered till not a soul escaped or
       re­mained alive. <verse eID="Josh.8.22"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.8.23" osisID="Josh.8.23"/> The king of Ai was taken alive and brought to

       Joshua, <verse eID="Josh.8.23"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.8.29" osisID="Josh.8.29"/> who hung him on a tree till evening; at sunset Joshua ordered his body to be
       taken down from the tree and thrown down at the entrance to the town-gate. They raised a cairn of stones over it, which

      <verse sID="Josh.9.1" osisID="Josh.9.1"/>When this was heard by all the kings west of the Jordan, in the highlands and the
       low­lands and all along the coast of the Mediterranean as far as Leb­anon, then Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites,
       Hivites, and Jebusites, <verse eID="Josh.9.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.2" osisID="Josh.9.2"/> gathered like one man to attack Joshua and Israel. <verse eID="Josh.9.2"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.3" osisID="Josh.9.3"/> But the citizens of Gibeon, hearing what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
      <verse eID="Josh.9.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.4" osisID="Josh.9.4"/> went to work craftily. They took provisions in old sacks on their asses, and old
       mended wineskins, <verse eID="Josh.9.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.5" osisID="Josh.9.5"/> with old patched shoes on their feet and old clothes on their bodies; the bread
       they took was all dry and crumbling. <verse eID="Josh.9.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.6" osisID="Josh.9.6"/> They went to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal and said to him and to the Israel­ites,
       <q>We have come from a far country; pray make a treaty with us.</q> <verse eID="Josh.9.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.7" osisID="Josh.9.7"/> The Israelites said to these Hivites, <q>Perhaps you live in our country, and
       why should we make a treaty with you?</q> <verse eID="Josh.9.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.8" osisID="Josh.9.8"/> <q>We are at your service,</q> they said to Joshua. <q>But who are you,</q>
       Joshua asked, <q>and where do you come from?</q> <verse eID="Josh.9.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.9" osisID="Josh.9.9"/> <q>From a country very far away,</q> they said, <q>and we have come on account
       of the Eternal, your God, for we have heard of his fame, of all he did in Egypt, <verse eID="Josh.9.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.10" osisID="Josh.9.10"/> and of all he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan, Sihon king of
       Heshbon and Og king of Bashan who reigned at Ashtaroth. <verse eID="Josh.9.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.11" osisID="Josh.9.11"/> Our sheikhs and all our people told us to take provisions with us for the
       journey and to go and meet you and say, <q>We are at your service; pray make a treaty with us.</q> <verse eID="Josh.9.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.12" osisID="Josh.9.12"/> This bread we took hot out of our houses on the day we started, and there,
       you see, it is dry and crumbling by this time! <verse eID="Josh.9.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.13" osisID="Josh.9.13"/> These wineskins were new when we filled them, and you see they are torn.
       These clothes and shoes of ours are worn out, owing to the long journey.</q> <verse eID="Josh.9.13"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.14" osisID="Josh.9.14"/> So the Israelites partook of their provisions, never asking the Eternal for
       advice; <verse eID="Josh.9.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.15" osisID="Josh.9.15"/> Joshua made peace with them and made a treaty with them to spare their lives,
       and the leaders of the com­munity swore an oath to them. <verse eID="Josh.9.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.16" osisID="Josh.9.16"/> Three days after they had made the treaty, they heard that the men were

      <verse sID="Josh.9.17" osisID="Josh.9.17"/> [[On the third day, as the Israelites marched forward, they came to their

      <verse sID="Josh.9.18" osisID="Josh.9.18"/> The Israelites did not kill them, because the leaders of the community had
       sworn an oath to them by the Eternal, the God of Israel. The community all grumbled against the leaders, <verse eID="Josh.9.18"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.19" osisID="Josh.9.19"/> but the leaders all replied, <q>We swore an oath to them by the Eternal the
       God of Israel: so now we cannot touch them. <verse eID="Josh.9.19"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.20" osisID="Josh.9.20"/> We must grant them the favour of their lives, lest wrath come upon us over the

      <verse sID="Josh.9.21" osisID="Josh.9.21"/> Let them live,</q> said the leaders. So they became wood-cutters and
       water-carriers to all the community, as the leaders directed.]] <verse eID="Josh.9.21"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.22" osisID="Josh.9.22"/> Then Joshua called for them and asked them, <q>Why have you deceived us by
       saying you came from far, far away, when you live in the same country as our­selves? <verse eID="Josh.9.22"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.23" osisID="Josh.9.23"/>
       A curse on you! You shall ever provide us with slaves

      <verse sID="Josh.9.24" osisID="Josh.9.24"/> They answered Joshua, <q>It was because your servants were as­sured that the
       Eternal your God had ordered his servant Moses to assign you all the land and to destroy all the natives before you. That
       put us in terror of our lives before you, and so we did this. <verse eID="Josh.9.24"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.25" osisID="Josh.9.25"/> Well, we are in your power. Whatever you think right and fair to do to us, do
       it.</q> <verse eID="Josh.9.25"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.26" osisID="Josh.9.26"/> This, then, was how Joshua treated them; he saved them from the Israelites
       and kept them from being murdered, <verse eID="Josh.9.26"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.9.27" osisID="Josh.9.27"/> but he made them that day wood­cutters and water-carriers for the community
       and for the altar of the Eternal, wherever the Eternal chooses. As they still are. <verse eID="Josh.9.27"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.10" sID="Josh.10"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.1" osisID="Josh.10.1"/>When Adonizedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and sacked
       it, treating Ai and its king as he had treated Jericho and its king, and that the citi­zens of Gibeon had made terms with
       Israel, <verse eID="Josh.10.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.2" osisID="Josh.10.2"/> he and his men were in terror; for Gibeon was a large town, like a royal city,
       larger than Ai, and all its men were stout fighters. <verse eID="Josh.10.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.3" osisID="Josh.10.3"/> So Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham the king of Hebron, to Piram the
       king of Jarmuth, to Japhia the king of Lakhish, and to Debir the king of Eglon, saying,
      <verse eID="Josh.10.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.4" osisID="Josh.10.4"/> <q>Join me and help me to storm Gib­eon, for it has made terms with Joshua and
       the Israelites.</q> <verse eID="Josh.10.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.5" osisID="Josh.10.5"/> The five Amorite kings, the king of Jerusalem and the king of Hebron and the
       king of Jarmuth and the king of Lakhish and the king of Eglon, all mustered and marched up with all their armies to
       besiege Gibeon and attack it. <verse eID="Josh.10.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.6" osisID="Josh.10.6"/> The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, telling him,
       <q>Abandon not your servants; quick, come up to rescue us, help us, for all the Amorite kings of the highlands have
       mustered to attack us.</q> <verse eID="Josh.10.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.7" osisID="Josh.10.7"/> Joshua marched up from Gilgal with all the troops and all the veterans. <verse eID="Josh.10.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.8" osisID="Josh.10.8"/> The Eternal said to Joshua, <q>Have no fear of them, for I put them into your
       hands; not a man of them shall hold his own against you.</q> <verse eID="Josh.10.8"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.9" osisID="Josh.10.9"/> So Joshua made a sudden attack; he made a night march from Gilgal, <verse eID="Josh.10.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.10" osisID="Josh.10.10"/> and the Eternal threw them into a panic be­fore Israel, till Israel routed
       them with heavy slaughter at Gibeon and then chased them along the road to the ascent of Beth-horon, routing them all the
        way to Azekah and Makkedah. <verse eID="Josh.10.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.11" osisID="Josh.10.11"/> As they ran from Israel, at the descent from Beth-horon the Eternal rained
       huge hail­stones from heaven upon them, all the way to Azekah; they died of these. Indeed, more died by the hailstones
       than at the hands of Israel by the sword. <verse eID="Josh.10.11"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.12" osisID="Josh.10.12"/> It was on the day when the Eternal handed over the Amorites to the
       Israelites that Joshua said to the Eternal before Israel,
       <q><lg>
        <l> O sun, stand over Gibeon! </l>
        <l> Move not, O moon, from Ajalon vale! </l>

      <verse sID="Josh.10.13" osisID="Josh.10.13"/>
        <l> The sun stood still, the moon moved not, </l>
        <l> till the folk had taken vengeance on their foes. </l>
       </lg></q>
       (Is not the song written in the Book of Heroes?) The sun stood still in the middle of the sky, and never hastened to set
       for about a whole day. <verse eID="Josh.10.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.14" osisID="Josh.10.14"/> Never was there a day like that, before or since, when the Eternal lis­tened
       to the cry of a man; for the Eternal was fighting for Israel.

      <milestone type="pb" n="253"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.16" osisID="Josh.10.16"/> The five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. <verse eID="Josh.10.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.17" osisID="Josh.10.17"/> When Joshua was told that the five kings had been dis­covered, hiding in the
       cave at Makkedah, <verse eID="Josh.10.17"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.18" osisID="Josh.10.18"/> he said, <q>Roll some large stones at the mouth of the cave and post men to

      <verse sID="Josh.10.19" osisID="Josh.10.19"/> but you must not stop pursuing your enemies. Strike down their rear, let

      <verse sID="Josh.10.20" osisID="Josh.10.20"/> When Joshua and the Israelites had finished slaughtering them with heavy

      <verse sID="Josh.10.21" osisID="Josh.10.21"/> the army all returned to Joshua at the camp at Makkedah unmolested; not a
       native dared say a word against any of the Israelites. <verse eID="Josh.10.21"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.22" osisID="Josh.10.22"/> Then Joshua ordered the mouth of the cave to be opened and the five kings
       brought out to him. <verse eID="Josh.10.22"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.23" osisID="Josh.10.23"/> This was done; the five kings were brought out, the king of Jeru­salem, the

     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.24" osisID="Josh.10.24"/> When these kings had been brought before Joshua, he called for all the men
       of Israel, and told the army commanders present to come forward and put their feet on the necks of the kings. They came
       forward and did put their feet on the necks of the kings. <verse eID="Josh.10.24"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.25" osisID="Josh.10.25"/> <q>Fear not,</q> said Joshua, <q>neither be dismayed; be firm and brave,
       for so shall the Eternal treat all the foes against whom you fight.</q> <verse eID="Josh.10.25"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.26" osisID="Josh.10.22"/> Then Joshua felled them and killed them; he hung them on five trees, and on
       the trees they re­mained hanging till evening. <verse eID="Josh.10.26"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.27" osisID="Josh.10.27"/> At sunset Joshua ordered the bodies to be taken down from the trees and
       thrown into the cave where they had hidden themselves. Some large stones were laid at the mouth of the cave, and are
       there to this day. <verse eID="Josh.10.27"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.10.28" osisID="Josh.10.28"/> That day Joshua stormed and sacked Makkedah, killing its king and utterly
       destroying it and all it contained, till not a single soul was left. He treated the king of Makkedah as he had treated

      <verse sID="Josh.10.38" osisID="Josh.10.38"/> he wiped the place out and every soul within it. Then Joshua and all Israel
