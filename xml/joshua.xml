     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.1" osisID="Josh.1.1"/>Now, after the death of Moses the servant of the Eter­nal, the Eternal said to
       Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses,
      <verse eID="Josh.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.2" osisID="Josh.1.2"/>
       <q>Moses my servant is dead; come, cross the Jordan here, you and all this people, into the land which I assign to them,
       to the Israelites. <verse eID="Josh.1.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.3" osisID="Josh.1.3"/> Every foot of ground you tread I assign to you, as I promised Moses; <verse eID="Josh.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.4" osisID="Josh.1.4"/> your frontier shall stretch from the desert to Leb­anon yonder, from the great
       River, the river Euphrates, over all the land of the Hittites, to the great Mediterranean Sea westward. <verse eID="Josh.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.5" osisID="Josh.1.5"/> Not a man shall be able to hold his own against you all the days of your life;
       as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never fail you nor forsake you. <verse eID="Josh.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.6" osisID="Josh.1.6"/> Be strong, be brave, for you shall put this people in possession of the land
       which I swore to their fathers that I would give them. <verse eID="Josh.1.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.7" osisID="Josh.1.7"/> Only be strong and brave, mindful to carry out all your orders from my servant
       Moses, turning neither to the right nor to the left, so that you may succeed wherever you go. <verse eID="Josh.1.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.8" osisID="Josh.1.8"/> This law­book you shall never cease to have on your lips; you must pore over it
       day and night, that you may be mindful to carry out all that is written in it, for so shall you make your way prosperous,
       so shall you succeed. <verse eID="Josh.1.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.9" osisID="Josh.1.9"/> These are my orders: be firm and brave, never be daunted or dismayed, for the
       Eternal your God is with you wherever you go.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.1.9"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.10" osisID="Josh.1.10"/> Then Joshua ordered the officers of the nation <verse eID="Josh.1.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.11" osisID="Josh.1.11"/> to go through the camp and com­mand the people to <q>Prepare food, for within
       three days you are going to cross the Jordan here and enter into possession of the land which the Eternal your God assigns
       you for your very own.</q> <verse eID="Josh.1.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.12" osisID="Josh.1.12"/> Joshua also said to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-clan of
       Manasseh, <verse eID="Josh.1.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.13" osisID="Josh.1.13"/> <q>Remember what Moses the servant of the Eternal com­manded you when he told
       you that the Eternal your God would settle you here and give you this region. <verse eID="Josh.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.14" osisID="Josh.1.14"/> Your wives, your children, and your cattle shall re­main in this land which
       Moses assigned you east of the Jordan, but you must march across un­der arms in front of your kins­men, every fighting man
       among you, to assist them, <verse eID="Josh.1.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.15" osisID="Josh.1.15"/> till the Eternal settles your kinsmen like yourselves, till they get posses­sion
       of the land which the Eter­nal your God assigns to them; then you may return to your own region and occupy the land
       assigned you by Moses the servant of the Eternal on the eastern bank of the Jordan.</q> <verse eID="Josh.1.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.16" osisID="Josh.1.16"/> They answered Joshua, <q>Whatever you command us we will do, and wherever you
       send us we will go. <verse eID="Josh.1.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.17" osisID="Josh.1.17"/> As we obeyed Moses in everything, so we will obey you; only may the Eternal
       your God be with you as he was with Moses! <verse eID="Josh.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.18" osisID="Josh.1.18"/> Whoever rebels against your orders and will not listen to what you say by way
       of command to him, that man shall be put to death. Only be firm and brave.</q> <verse eID="Josh.1.18"/>

     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.1" osisID="Josh.2.1"/> From Shittim Joshua sent two men secretly as spies to explore the country and
       <milestone type="pb" n="243"/>
       specially Jericho. When they ar­rived, they went into the house of a harlot called Rahab and stayed there. <verse eID="Josh.2.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.2" osisID="Josh.2.2"/> The king of Jericho was told that two men of Israel had come in that night to
       find out about the country; <verse eID="Josh.2.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.3" osisID="Josh.2.3"/> so he sent a message to Rahab to <q>Bring out the two men who have come to you,
       who have entered your house, for they are here to find out all about the country.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.4" osisID="Josh.2.4"/> The woman, who had taken the men and hid them, said, <q>Yes, the men did come to
       me, but I did not know where they came from, <verse eID="Josh.2.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.5" osisID="Josh.2.5"/> and just about the hour for shutting the town-gate, when it was dark, the men
       went off. Where they went, I do not know. Quick, pursue them, for you will overtake them.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.6" osisID="Josh.2.6"/> Now she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax
       which she had arranged on the roof. <verse eID="Josh.2.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.7" osisID="Josh.2.7"/> The pursuers went by the road to the Jordan, as far as the fords, and as soon as
       they left the town the gate was shut. <verse eID="Josh.2.7"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.8" osisID="Josh.2.8"/> The two men had not lain down, before the woman came to them on the roof <verse eID="Josh.2.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.9" osisID="Josh.2.9"/> and said, <q>I know that the Eternal has given you this country, and how the
       terror of you has fallen upon us, till all the natives are quivering before you. <verse eID="Josh.2.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.10" osisID="Josh.2.10"/> For we have heard how the Eternal dried up the water of the Reed Sea before
       you, when you left Egypt, and how you treated the two Amorite kings on the east of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you
       wiped off the earth. <verse eID="Josh.2.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.11" osisID="Josh.2.11"/> As soon as we heard it, our hearts quivered and everyone became utterly
       dispirited be­cause of you, for the Eternal your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. <verse eID="Josh.2.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.12" osisID="Josh.2.12"/> Now then, since I have dealt kindly with you, pray swear to me by the Eternal
       that you will deal kindly with my family, and give me a sure sign of it; <verse eID="Josh.2.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.13" osisID="Josh.2.13"/> swear that you will spare the lives of my father and my mother and my brothers
       and my sisters and all they have, saving us from death.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.14" osisID="Josh.2.14"/> The men re­plied, <q>Our lives for yours--only you must not breathe a word
       about our errand; then we will deal kindly and honestly with you when the Eternal gives us the country.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.17" osisID="Josh.2.17"/> The men told her, The men told her, <q>We will not be bound by this oath to
       you, which you have made us swear, <verse eID="Josh.2.17"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.18" osisID="Josh.2.18"/> unless, when we enter the country, you tie this cord of scarlet thread outside
       the win­dow through which you let us down. You must gather your father and mother and brothers and all your family
       inside your house; <verse eID="Josh.2.18"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.19" osisID="Josh.2.19"/> anyone who crosses the door of your house into the street, his blood be on his
       own head, we are not to blame; but if a hand is laid on anyone in­side the house, then his blood be on our head! <verse eID="Josh.2.19"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.20" osisID="Josh.2.20"/> But remember, if you breathe a word about our errand, we will not be bound by
       the oath you have made us swear.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.20"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.21" osisID="Josh.2.21"/> <q>As you say,</q> answered the woman, <q>so be it.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.2.21"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.15" osisID="Josh.2.15"/> Then she lowered them by a rope out of the window, for her house was on the
       town-wall; she stayed on the town-wall. <verse eID="Josh.2.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.16" osisID="Josh.2.16"/> She told them, <q>Get away to the hills, lest the pursuers come across you;
       hide yourselves there for three days till the pur­suers return, and then make your retreat.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.2.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.21" osisID="Josh.2.21"/> So away they went, while she tied the scarlet cord to the window. <verse eID="Josh.2.21"/>
      <milestone type="pb" n="243"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.22" osisID="Josh.2.22"/> They went into the hills and stayed there for three days, till the pursuers
       returned (the pur­suers looked for them all along the road and could not find them). <verse eID="Josh.2.22"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.23" osisID="Josh.2.23"/> Then the two men came down from the hills and crossed over to Joshua the son
       of Nun, telling him all that had befallen them; <verse eID="Josh.2.23"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.24" osisID="Josh.2.24"/> they said to Joshua, <q>The Eternal has put all the country into our hands.
       The natives are all quivering before us!</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.24"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.3" sID="Josh.3"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.1" osisID="Josh.3.1"/>In the morning Joshua rose; he and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and
       reached the Jordan, where they passed the night before they crossed over. <verse eID="Josh.3.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.2" osisID="Josh.3.2"/> Three days afterwards the officers went through the camp <verse eID="Josh.3.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.3" osisID="Josh.3.3"/> and gave this order to the nation: <q>When you see the ark of the compact of the
       Eter­nal your God being carried by the priestly Levites, then set out and follow it, <verse eID="Josh.3.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.4" osisID="Josh.3.4"/> so that you may learn the ford by which you are to cross; for you have never
       crossed here before. Only, you must not come close to the ark; between it and you there must be a space kept of one
       thousand yards.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.5" osisID="Josh.3.5"/> Then Joshua said to the people, <q>Consecrate yourselves, for to-morrow the
       Eternal will do wonders among you.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.6" osisID="Josh.3.6"/> To the priests he said, <q>Lift the ark of the compact and go in front of the
       people.</q> So they lifted the ark of the compact and went in front of the people. <verse eID="Josh.3.6"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.7" osisID="Josh.3.7"/> The Eternal said to Joshua, <q>This day I begin to exalt you in the sight of
       Israel, to let them see that as I was with Moses so I will be with you. <verse eID="Josh.3.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.8" osisID="Josh.3.8"/> Order the priests who are carrying the ark of the compact to stand still in the
       Jordan as soon as they reach the edge of the water.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.8"/>
    <chapter eID="Josh.3"/>
    <chapter osisID="Josh.4" sID="Josh.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.1" osisID="Josh.4.1"/> The Eternal also said to Joshua, <verse eID="Josh.4.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.2" osisID="Josh.4.2"/> <q>Take twelve men from the nation, a man from each clan,<verse eID="Josh.4.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.3" osisID="Josh.4.3"/> and order them to take twelve stones out of the Jordan from the spot where the
       feet of the priest stood firm; they must carry these stones across and place them on the spot where you spend the night.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.4.3"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.3" sID="Josh.3"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.9" osisID="Josh.3.9"/> Then Joshua bade the Israelites come and listen to the words of the Eternal,
       their God. <verse eID="Josh.3.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.10" osisID="Josh.3.10"/> Joshua said, <q>This is to let you see that the living God is among you, and
       that he will without fail evict before you the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the
       Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite. <verse eID="Josh.3.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.11" osisID="Josh.3.11"/> See, the ark of the compact of the Lord of all the earth is crossing the
       Jordan in front of you. <verse eID="Josh.3.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.12" osisID="Josh.3.12"/> Now choose twelve men from the clans of Israel, a man from each clan. <verse eID="Josh.3.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.13" osisID="Josh.3.13"/> As soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the
       compact of the Eternal, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the water of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be
       stopped; the waters which are flowing down, they shall be dammed up.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.14" osisID="Josh.3.14"/> When the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, headed by the priests
       who carried the ark of the compact, <verse eID="Josh.3.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.15" osisID="Josh.3.15"/> as soon as the bearers reached the Jordan and the feet of the priests dipped
       in the water at the edge (for the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest), <verse eID="Josh.3.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.16" osisID="Josh.3.16"/> the waters that flow down stopped and were dammed up at a distance, at Adamah
       (a town beside Zartan), while the waters that flow away to the sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) were cut off and
       <milestone type="pb" n="244"/>
       failed. In this way the people crossed, opposite Jericho. <verse eID="Josh.3.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.17" osisID="Josh.3.17"/> The priests who carried the ark of the compact of the Eternal stood still on
       dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, and all Israel crossed on dry ground until the whole nation had finished
       crossing. <verse eID="Josh.3.17"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.4" sID="Josh.4"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.1" osisID="Josh.4.1"/>When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan,<verse eID="Josh.4.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.4" osisID="Josh.4.4"/> Joshua called the twelve men of Israel whom he had ready, one from each of the
       clans; <verse eID="Josh.4.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.5" osisID="Josh.4.5"/> Joshua said to them, <q>Cross in front of the ark of the Eternal your God
       through the Jordan, each of you taking a stone on his shoulder, one for each of the clans of Israel. <verse eID="Josh.4.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.6" osisID="Josh.4.6"/> They are to be a sign for your nation. When your children in after days ask what
       is the meaning of these stones, <verse eID="Josh.4.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.7" osisID="Josh.4.7"/> you shall tell them it was because the waters of the Jordan were stopped be­fore
       the ark of the compact of the Eternal, stopped when it crossed the Jordan; these stones shall be a memorial for Israel
       for all time.</q> <verse eID="Josh.4.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.8" osisID="Josh.4.8"/> The Israelites did as Joshua gave orders; they lifted twelve stones out of the
       Jordan, as the Eternal had com­manded Joshua, one for each of the clans of Israel, and carried them over along with them
       to the spot where they spent the night, laying them down there. <verse eID="Josh.4.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.9" osisID="Josh.4.9"/> [[Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan on the spot where the
       feet of the priests who carried the ark of the compact had stood; they are there to this day. <verse eID="Josh.4.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.10" osisID="Josh.4.10"/> For the priests who carried the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan till all

       people hurried over, <verse eID="Josh.4.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.11" osisID="Josh.4.11"/> and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark passed over, the
       priests advancing to the front of the people. <verse eID="Josh.4.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.12" osisID="Josh.4.12"/> The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half clan of Manasseh passed across under
       arms in front of the Israelites, as Moses had ordered them, <verse eID="Josh.4.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.13" osisID="Josh.4.13"/> about forty thousand men equipped for war, crossing under the eyes of the
       Eternal to the steppes of Jericho for battle. <verse eID="Josh.4.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.14" osisID="Josh.4.14"/> The Eternal exalted Joshua that day in the eyes of all Israel; they stood in
       awe of him as they had stood in awe of Moses all the days of his life. <verse eID="Josh.4.14"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.15" osisID="Josh.4.15"/> Then the Eternal said to Joshua, <verse eID="Josh.4.15"/>

       from the Jor­dan, when the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted on to the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan

      <verse sID="Josh.4.19" osisID="Josh.4.19"/> It was on the tenth day of the first month that the people came up from the

      <verse sID="Josh.4.20" osisID="Josh.4.20"/> These twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan were set up by Joshua at
       Gilgal. <verse eID="Josh.4.20"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.21" osisID="Josh.4.21"/> He said to the Israelites, <q>When your children in after days ask their

      <verse eID="Josh.4.22"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.23" osisID="Josh.4.23"/> For the Eternal your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you till you

      <verse sID="Josh.5.1" osisID="Josh.5.1"/>Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings by
       the Mediterranean heard how the Eternal had dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of the Israelites till they had
       got across, their hearts quivered and they were all dispirited, on account of the Israelites. <verse eID="Josh.5.1"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.2" osisID="Josh.5.2"/> It was then that the Eternal said to Joshua, <q>Make flint knives and
       circumcise the Israelites once more.</q> <verse eID="Josh.5.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.3" osisID="Josh.5.3"/> So Joshua made flint knives and cir­cumcised the Israelites at the Hill of
       Foreskins. <verse eID="Josh.5.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.9" osisID="Josh.5.9"/> Then said the Eternal to Joshua, <q>And now I have rolled off you the scorn of
       the Egyptians.</q> Hence the name of the spot was called Rollstone (Gilgal), and is so called to this day. <verse eID="Josh.5.9"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.4" osisID="Josh.5.4"/> [[Joshua circumcised them for this reason. All who had left Egypt, all the male

      <verse sID="Josh.5.5" osisID="Josh.5.5"/> These who had left Egypt were circumcised, but none of the people who had been

      <verse sID="Josh.5.6" osisID="Josh.5.6"/> For forty years the Israelites had journeyed in the desert until the whole
       nation of war­riors who had left Egypt had perished, because they would not listen to what the Eternal said, and because
       the Eternal had sworn to them that he would not let them see the land which the Eternal had sworn to their fathers that
       he would give to us, a land abounding in milk and honey. <verse eID="Josh.5.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.7" osisID="Josh.5.7"/> So their children, whom the Eternal raised up instead of them, were circum­cised
       by Joshua, since they had never been circumcised from time to time. <verse eID="Josh.5.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.8" osisID="Josh.5.8"/> After the circumcising was over, the whole na­tion remained where they were in
       the camp till they had re­covered.]] <verse eID="Josh.5.8"/>

      <verse sID="Josh.5.10" osisID="Josh.5.10"/> When the Israelites were in camp at Gilgal, they kept the passover on the
       evening of the fourteenth day of the month, on the steppes of Jericho. <verse eID="Josh.5.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.11" osisID="Josh.5.11"/> The day after the passover, they ate some of the produce of the land,
       unleavened cakes and roasted grain. <verse eID="Josh.5.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.12" osisID="Josh.5.12"/> And that very day the manna ceased, once they ate the produce of the land; the
       Israelites no longer had manna, but ate hereafter the food of the land of Canaan. <verse eID="Josh.5.12"/>

      <verse sID="Josh.5.13" osisID="Josh.5.13"/> Joshua was one day near Jericho, when he raised his eyes and saw a man
       standing before him, holding a drawn sword. Joshua went up to him and said, <q>Are you for us, or are you for our
       enemies?</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.5.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.14" osisID="Josh.5.14"/> <q>No,</q> he answered, <q>I am here as the captain of the host of the
       Eternal.</q> Then Joshua fell on his face to the ground and wor­shipped, saying, <q>And what has my Lord to say to his
       servant?</q> <verse eID="Josh.5.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.5.15" osisID="Josh.5.15"/> The captain of the host of the Eternal said to Joshua, <q>Re­move your sandals
       from your feet, for the place where you are standing is sacred.</q> Joshua did so. <verse eID="Josh.5.15"/>

       men. <verse eID="Josh.6.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.3" osisID="Josh.6.3"/> For six days you and all your men at arms shall march round the town once a day,
      <verse eID="Josh.6.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.4" osisID="Josh.6.4"/> with seven priests carrying seven rams' horns as trumpets in front of the ark.
      <verse eID="Josh.6.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.5" osisID="Josh.6.5"/> On the seventh day you shall march round the town seven times, and the priests
       shall blow a trumpet blast. As soon as they blow a long trumpet blast on the horns, whenever you hear the sound, then all
       the people must raise a mighty shout, and the wall of the town will fall down flat, till every man of you can march in,
       straight in front of him.</q> <verse eID="Josh.6.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.6" osisID="Josh.6.6"/> So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and told them to lift the ark of the
       compact and let seven priests carry seven rams' horns as trumpets in front of the ark of the Eternal. <verse eID="Josh.6.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.7" osisID="Josh.6.7"/> Then he told the people, <q>Forward, march round the town, with the armed men in
       front of the ark of the Eternal; <verse eID="Josh.6.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.8" osisID="Josh.6.8"/> let the seven priests with the trumpets of rams' horns go ahead, in pres­ence of
       the Eternal, blowing the trumpets, and followed by the ark of the compact of the Eternal. <verse eID="Josh.6.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.9" osisID="Josh.6.9"/> Let the armed men go in front of the priests who blow the trumpets, and let the
       rear-guard follow the ark, the trumpets blowing.</q> <verse eID="Josh.6.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.10" osisID="Josh.6.10"/> To the people Joshua said, <q>You must not shout nor cry, you must not say a
       word, until I tell you to shout; then shout.</q> <verse eID="Josh.6.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.11" osisID="Josh.6.11"/> He had the ark of the Eternal car­ried round the town, going round it once;
       then all retired to the camp and passed the night there. <verse eID="Josh.6.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.12" osisID="Josh.6.12"/> Next morning Joshua rose, the priests lifted the ark of the Eternal, <verse eID="Josh.6.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.13" osisID="Josh.6.13"/> and the seven priests carrying the seven rams' horns as trumpets kept on in
       front of the ark of the Eternal, blowing a blast, preceded by the armed men, with the rear­guard after the ark, the
       trum­pets blowing as they went. <verse eID="Josh.6.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.14" osisID="Josh.6.14"/> On the second day they marched round the town once, and then retired to the
       camp. This they did for six days. <verse eID="Josh.6.14"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.15" osisID="Josh.6.15"/> On the seventh day they rose at dawn and marched round the town seven times;
      this was the only day they marched seven times round it. <verse eID="Josh.6.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.16" osisID="Josh.6.16"/> The seventh time, when the priests blew their blast, Joshua said to the
       people, <q>Shout, for the Eternal has given you the town. <verse eID="Josh.6.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.17" osisID="Josh.6.17"/> It shall be doomed to destruction, the town and all in it; only Rahab the
       harlot shall be spared, she and all who are with her in her house, because she hid the mes­sengers whom we sent. <verse eID="Josh.6.17"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.18" osisID="Josh.6.18"/> As for you, hands off any of the doomed spoil, lest you desire it and take
       some of it! That would be the ruin and undoing of the camp of Israel. <verse eID="Josh.6.18"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.19" osisID="Josh.6.19"/> No, all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the
       Eternal and must come to the treasury of the Eternal.</q> <verse eID="Josh.6.19"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.20" osisID="Josh.6.20"/> Then the people shouted, at the trumpet blast. And when the people heard the
       sound of the trumpet blast and raised a mighty shout, down the wall fell flat, till every man could march in, straight
       in front of him. <verse eID="Josh.6.20"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.21" osisID="Josh.6.21"/> In they marched and so they took the town, massacring all inside, men and
       women, old and young alike, oxen, sheep, and asses, giving no quarter. <verse eID="Josh.6.21"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.22" osisID="Josh.6.22"/> But Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the country, <q>Go to the
       harlot’s house and fetch the woman out, with all she has, as you swore to her.</q> <verse eID="Josh.6.22"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.23" osisID="Josh.6.23"/> So the young spies went and brought Rahab out, with her
       <milestone type="pb" n="248"/>
       father and mother and brothers and all she had, all her family; they placed them outside the camp of Israel. <verse eID="Josh.6.23"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.24" osisID="Josh.6.24"/> The town and all in it they burned up; only the silver and gold and all the
       arti­cles of bronze and iron they put into the treasury of the Eternal. <verse eID="Josh.6.24"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.25" osisID="Josh.6.25"/> Rahab the harlot and her family and all she had, Joshua spared; she lived
       among the Israelites, as do her descendants to this day, because she hid the mes­sengers whom Joshua sent to spy out
       Jericho. <verse eID="Josh.6.25"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.26" osisID="Josh.6.26"/> Joshua then laid this oath upon the people: <q>Cursed before the Eternal be
       the man who starts to rebuild this town of Jericho! At the cost of his oldest son shall he lay its foun­dation, and at the
       cost of his youngest son shall he erect its gates.</q> <verse eID="Josh.6.26"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.6.27" osisID="Josh.6.27"/> The Eternal was with Joshua, and the fame of him spread all over the land. <verse eID="Josh.6.27"/>
