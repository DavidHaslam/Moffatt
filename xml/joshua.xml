      <verse sID="Josh.1.1" osisID="Josh.1.1"/>Now, after the death of Moses the servant of the Eter­nal, the Eternal said to
       Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses,
      <verse eID="Josh.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.2" osisID="Josh.1.2"/>
       <q>Moses my servant is dead; come, cross the Jordan here, you and all this people, into the land which I assign to them,
       to the Israelites. <verse eID="Josh.1.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.3" osisID="Josh.1.3"/> Every foot of ground you tread I assign to you, as I promised Moses; <verse eID="Josh.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.4" osisID="Josh.1.4"/> your frontier shall stretch from the desert to Leb­anon yonder, from the great
       River, the river Euphrates, over all the land of the Hittites, to the great Mediterranean Sea westward. <verse eID="Josh.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.5" osisID="Josh.1.5"/> Not a man shall be able to hold his own against you all the days of your life;
       as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never fail you nor forsake you. <verse eID="Josh.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.6" osisID="Josh.1.6"/> Be strong, be brave, for you shall put this people in possession of the land
       which I swore to their fathers that I would give them. <verse eID="Josh.1.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.7" osisID="Josh.1.7"/> Only be strong and brave, mindful to carry out all your orders from my servant
       Moses, turning neither to the right nor to the left, so that you may succeed wherever you go. <verse eID="Josh.1.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.8" osisID="Josh.1.8"/> This law­book you shall never cease to have on your lips; you must pore over it
       day and night, that you may be mindful to carry out all that is written in it, for so shall you make your way prosperous,
       so shall you succeed. <verse eID="Josh.1.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.9" osisID="Josh.1.9"/> These are my orders: be firm and brave, never be daunted or dismayed, for the
       Eternal your God is with you wherever you go.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.1.9"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.10" osisID="Josh.1.10"/> Then Joshua ordered the officers of the nation <verse eID="Josh.1.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.11" osisID="Josh.1.11"/> to go through the camp and com­mand the people to <q>Prepare food, for within
       three days you are going to cross the Jordan here and enter into possession of the land which the Eternal your God assigns
       you for your very own.</q> <verse eID="Josh.1.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.12" osisID="Josh.1.12"/> Joshua also said to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-clan of
       Manasseh, <verse eID="Josh.1.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.13" osisID="Josh.1.13"/> <q>Remember what Moses the servant of the Eternal com­manded you when he told
       you that the Eternal your God would settle you here and give you this region. <verse eID="Josh.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.14" osisID="Josh.1.14"/> Your wives, your children, and your cattle shall re­main in this land which
       Moses assigned you east of the Jordan, but you must march across un­der arms in front of your kins­men, every fighting man
       among you, to assist them, <verse eID="Josh.1.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.15" osisID="Josh.1.15"/> till the Eternal settles your kinsmen like yourselves, till they get posses­sion
       of the land which the Eter­nal your God assigns to them; then you may return to your own region and occupy the land
       assigned you by Moses the servant of the Eternal on the eastern bank of the Jordan.</q> <verse eID="Josh.1.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.16" osisID="Josh.1.16"/> They answered Joshua, <q>Whatever you command us we will do, and wherever you
       send us we will go. <verse eID="Josh.1.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.17" osisID="Josh.1.17"/> As we obeyed Moses in everything, so we will obey you; only may the Eternal
       your God be with you as he was with Moses! <verse eID="Josh.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.1.18" osisID="Josh.1.18"/> Whoever rebels against your orders and will not listen to what you say by way
       of command to him, that man shall be put to death. Only be firm and brave.</q> <verse eID="Josh.1.18"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.2" sID="Josh.2"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.1" osisID="Josh.2.1"/> From Shittim Joshua sent two men secretly as spies to explore the country and
       <milestone type="pb" n="243"/>
       specially Jericho. When they ar­rived, they went into the house of a harlot called Rahab and stayed there. <verse eID="Josh.2.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.2" osisID="Josh.2.2"/> The king of Jericho was told that two men of Israel had come in that night to
       find out about the country; <verse eID="Josh.2.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.3" osisID="Josh.2.3"/> so he sent a message to Rahab to <q>Bring out the two men who have come to you,
       who have entered your house, for they are here to find out all about the country.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.4" osisID="Josh.2.4"/> The woman, who had taken the men and hid them, said, <q>Yes, the men did come to
       me, but I did not know where they came from, <verse eID="Josh.2.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.5" osisID="Josh.2.5"/> and just about the hour for shutting the town-gate, when it was dark, the men
       went off. Where they went, I do not know. Quick, pursue them, for you will overtake them.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.6" osisID="Josh.2.6"/> Now she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax
       which she had arranged on the roof. <verse eID="Josh.2.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.7" osisID="Josh.2.7"/> The pursuers went by the road to the Jordan, as far as the fords, and as soon as
       they left the town the gate was shut. <verse eID="Josh.2.7"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.8" osisID="Josh.2.8"/> The two men had not lain down, before the woman came to them on the roof <verse eID="Josh.2.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.9" osisID="Josh.2.9"/> and said, <q>I know that the Eternal has given you this country, and how the
       terror of you has fallen upon us, till all the natives are quivering before you. <verse eID="Josh.2.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.10" osisID="Josh.2.10"/> For we have heard how the Eternal dried up the water of the Reed Sea before
       you, when you left Egypt, and how you treated the two Amorite kings on the east of the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you
       wiped off the earth. <verse eID="Josh.2.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.11" osisID="Josh.2.11"/> As soon as we heard it, our hearts quivered and everyone became utterly
       dispirited be­cause of you, for the Eternal your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. <verse eID="Josh.2.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.12" osisID="Josh.2.12"/> Now then, since I have dealt kindly with you, pray swear to me by the Eternal
       that you will deal kindly with my family, and give me a sure sign of it; <verse eID="Josh.2.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.13" osisID="Josh.2.13"/> swear that you will spare the lives of my father and my mother and my brothers
       and my sisters and all they have, saving us from death.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.14" osisID="Josh.2.14"/> The men re­plied, <q>Our lives for yours--only you must not breathe a word
       about our errand; then we will deal kindly and honestly with you when the Eternal gives us the country.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.17" osisID="Josh.2.17"/> The men told her, The men told her, <q>We will not be bound by this oath to
       you, which you have made us swear, <verse eID="Josh.2.17"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.18" osisID="Josh.2.18"/> unless, when we enter the country, you tie this cord of scarlet thread outside
       the win­dow through which you let us down. You must gather your father and mother and brothers and all your family
       inside your house; <verse eID="Josh.2.18"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.19" osisID="Josh.2.19"/> anyone who crosses the door of your house into the street, his blood be on his
       own head, we are not to blame; but if a hand is laid on anyone in­side the house, then his blood be on our head! <verse eID="Josh.2.19"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.20" osisID="Josh.2.20"/> But remember, if you breathe a word about our errand, we will not be bound by
       the oath you have made us swear.</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.20"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.21" osisID="Josh.2.21"/> <q>As you say,</q> answered the woman, <q>so be it.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.2.21"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.15" osisID="Josh.2.15"/> Then she lowered them by a rope out of the window, for her house was on the
       town-wall; she stayed on the town-wall. <verse eID="Josh.2.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.16" osisID="Josh.2.16"/> She told them, <q>Get away to the hills, lest the pursuers come across you;
       hide yourselves there for three days till the pur­suers return, and then make your retreat.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.2.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.21" osisID="Josh.2.21"/> So away they went, while she tied the scarlet cord to the window. <verse eID="Josh.2.21"/>
      <milestone type="pb" n="243"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.22" osisID="Josh.2.22"/> They went into the hills and stayed there for three days, till the pursuers
       returned (the pur­suers looked for them all along the road and could not find them). <verse eID="Josh.2.22"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.23" osisID="Josh.2.23"/> Then the two men came down from the hills and crossed over to Joshua the son
       of Nun, telling him all that had befallen them; <verse eID="Josh.2.23"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.2.24" osisID="Josh.2.24"/> they said to Joshua, <q>The Eternal has put all the country into our hands.
       The natives are all quivering before us!</q> <verse eID="Josh.2.24"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.3" sID="Josh.3"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.1" osisID="Josh.3.1"/>In the morning Joshua rose; he and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and
       reached the Jordan, where they passed the night before they crossed over. <verse eID="Josh.3.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.2" osisID="Josh.3.2"/> Three days afterwards the officers went through the camp <verse eID="Josh.3.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.3" osisID="Josh.3.3"/> and gave this order to the nation: <q>When you see the ark of the compact of the
       Eter­nal your God being carried by the priestly Levites, then set out and follow it, <verse eID="Josh.3.3"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.4" osisID="Josh.3.4"/> so that you may learn the ford by which you are to cross; for you have never
       crossed here before. Only, you must not come close to the ark; between it and you there must be a space kept of one
       thousand yards.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.5" osisID="Josh.3.5"/> Then Joshua said to the people, <q>Consecrate yourselves, for to-morrow the
       Eternal will do wonders among you.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.6" osisID="Josh.3.6"/> To the priests he said, <q>Lift the ark of the compact and go in front of the
       people.</q> So they lifted the ark of the compact and went in front of the people. <verse eID="Josh.3.6"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.7" osisID="Josh.3.7"/> The Eternal said to Joshua, <q>This day I begin to exalt you in the sight of
       Israel, to let them see that as I was with Moses so I will be with you. <verse eID="Josh.3.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.8" osisID="Josh.3.8"/> Order the priests who are carrying the ark of the compact to stand still in the
       Jordan as soon as they reach the edge of the water.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.8"/>
    <chapter eID="Josh.3"/>
    <chapter osisID="Josh.4" sID="Josh.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.1" osisID="Josh.4.1"/> The Eternal also said to Joshua, <verse eID="Josh.4.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.2" osisID="Josh.4.2"/> <q>Take twelve men from the nation, a man from each clan,<verse eID="Josh.4.2"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.3" osisID="Josh.4.3"/> and order them to take twelve stones out of the Jordan from the spot where the
       feet of the priest stood firm; they must carry these stones across and place them on the spot where you spend the night.</q>
      <verse eID="Josh.4.3"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.3" sID="Josh.3"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.9" osisID="Josh.3.9"/> Then Joshua bade the Israelites come and listen to the words of the Eternal,
       their God. <verse eID="Josh.3.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.10" osisID="Josh.3.10"/> Joshua said, <q>This is to let you see that the living God is among you, and
       that he will without fail evict before you the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the
       Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite. <verse eID="Josh.3.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.11" osisID="Josh.3.11"/> See, the ark of the compact of the Lord of all the earth is crossing the
       Jordan in front of you. <verse eID="Josh.3.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.12" osisID="Josh.3.12"/> Now choose twelve men from the clans of Israel, a man from each clan. <verse eID="Josh.3.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.13" osisID="Josh.3.13"/> As soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the
       compact of the Eternal, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the water of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be
       stopped; the waters which are flowing down, they shall be dammed up.</q> <verse eID="Josh.3.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.14" osisID="Josh.3.14"/> When the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, headed by the priests
       who carried the ark of the compact, <verse eID="Josh.3.14"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.15" osisID="Josh.3.15"/> as soon as the bearers reached the Jordan and the feet of the priests dipped
       in the water at the edge (for the Jordan overflows its banks all the time of harvest), <verse eID="Josh.3.15"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.16" osisID="Josh.3.16"/> the waters that flow down stopped and were dammed up at a distance, at Adamah
       (a town beside Zartan), while the waters that flow away to the sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) were cut off and
       <milestone type="pb" n="244"/>
       failed. In this way the people crossed, opposite Jericho. <verse eID="Josh.3.16"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.3.17" osisID="Josh.3.17"/> The priests who carried the ark of the compact of the Eternal stood still on
       dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, and all Israel crossed on dry ground until the whole nation had finished
       crossing. <verse eID="Josh.3.17"/>

    <chapter osisID="Josh.4" sID="Josh.4"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.1" osisID="Josh.4.1"/>When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan,<verse eID="Josh.4.1"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.4" osisID="Josh.4.4"/> Joshua called the twelve men of Israel whom he had ready, one from each of the
       clans; <verse eID="Josh.4.4"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.5" osisID="Josh.4.5"/> Joshua said to them, <q>Cross in front of the ark of the Eternal your God
       through the Jordan, each of you taking a stone on his shoulder, one for each of the clans of Israel. <verse eID="Josh.4.5"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.6" osisID="Josh.4.6"/> They are to be a sign for your nation. When your children in after days ask what
       is the meaning of these stones, <verse eID="Josh.4.6"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.7" osisID="Josh.4.7"/> you shall tell them it was because the waters of the Jordan were stopped be­fore
       the ark of the compact of the Eternal, stopped when it crossed the Jordan; these stones shall be a memorial for Israel
       for all time.</q> <verse eID="Josh.4.7"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.8" osisID="Josh.4.8"/> The Israelites did as Joshua gave orders; they lifted twelve stones out of the
       Jordan, as the Eternal had com­manded Joshua, one for each of the clans of Israel, and carried them over along with them
       to the spot where they spent the night, laying them down there. <verse eID="Josh.4.8"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.9" osisID="Josh.4.9"/> [[Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan on the spot where the
       feet of the priests who carried the ark of the compact had stood; they are there to this day. <verse eID="Josh.4.9"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.10" osisID="Josh.4.10"/> For the priests who carried the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan till all
       was finished that Joshua was told by the Eternal to enjoin upon the people, all that Moses had commanded Joshua.]] The
       people hurried over, <verse eID="Josh.4.10"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.11" osisID="Josh.4.11"/> and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark passed over, the
       priests advancing to the front of the people. <verse eID="Josh.4.11"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.12" osisID="Josh.4.12"/> The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half clan of Manasseh passed across under
       arms in front of the Israelites, as Moses had ordered them, <verse eID="Josh.4.12"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.13" osisID="Josh.4.13"/> about forty thousand men equipped for war, crossing under the eyes of the
       Eternal to the steppes of Jericho for battle. <verse eID="Josh.4.13"/>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.14" osisID="Josh.4.14"/> The Eternal exalted Joshua that day in the eyes of all Israel; they stood in
       awe of him as they had stood in awe of Moses all the days of his life. <verse eID="Josh.4.14"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="Josh.4.15" osisID="Josh.4.15"/> Then the Eternal said to Joshua, <verse eID="Josh.4.15"/>

       from the Jor­dan, when the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted on to the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan

      <verse sID="Josh.4.19" osisID="Josh.4.19"/> It was on the tenth day of the first month that the people came up from the
