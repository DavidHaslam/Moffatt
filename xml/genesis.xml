     <chapter osisId="Gen.1" sId="Gen.1"/>
      <verse sID="Gen.1.1" osisID="Gen.1.1"/>When God began to form the universe, <verse eID="Gen.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="Gen.1.2" osisID="Gen.1.2"/> the world was void and vacant, darkness lay over the abyss; but
       the spirit of God was hovering over the waters, <verse eID="Gen.1.2"/>
      <verse sID="Gen.1.3" osisID="Gen.1.3"/>God said, <q>Let there be light,</q> and there was light. <verse eid="Gen.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="Gen.1.4" osisID="Gen.1.4"/>God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness;<verse eid="Gen.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="Gen.1.5" osisID="Gen.1.5"/>God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night. Evening came and
       morn­ing came, making one day. <verse eid="Gen.1.5"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.6" sID="Gen.1.6"/>Then God said, <q>Let there be a Vault between the waters, to divide them</q>;<verse eID="Gen.1.6"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.7" sID="Gen.1.7"/>so God made the Vault, dividing the waters un­der the Vault from the waters <verse eID="Gen.1.7"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.8" sID="Gen.1.8"/> above the Vault, and God called the Vault heaven. Evening came and morning
       came, making the second day. <verse eID="Gen.1.8"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.9" sID="Gen.1.9"/> Then God said, <q>Let the waters below the heaven be gathered into one place, to
       let dry land appear.</q> <verse eID="Gen.1.9"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.10" sID="Gen.1.10"/> And so it was. God called the dry land Earth, and the gath­ered waters he called Sea. <verse eID="Gen.1.10"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.11" sID="Gen.1.11"/>
       God saw that it was good. And God said, <q>Let the earth put out verdure, plants that bear seed and trees yielding fruit of
       every kind, fruit with seed in it.</q>
      <verse eID="Gen.1.11"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.12" sID="Gen.1.12"/> And so it was; the earth brought forth verdure, plants bearing seed of every kind
       and trees yielding fruit of every kind,
       <milestone type="column" n="2"/>
       fruit with seed in it. God saw that it was good.
      <verse eID="Gen.1.12"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.13" sID="Gen.1.13"/> Evening came and morning came, making the third day. <verse eID="Gen.1.13"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.14" sID="Gen.1.14"/> Then God said, <q>Let there be lights in the Vault of heaven to separate day from
       night, to mark out the sacred seasons, the days and the years;
      <verse eID="Gen.1.14"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.15" sID="Gen.1.15"/> let them shine in the Vault of heaven, to shed light on the earth</q>; and so it was. <verse eID="Gen.1.15"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.16" sID="Gen.1.16"/> For God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, the lesser
       light to­gether with the stars to rule the night; <verse eID="Gen.1.16"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.17" sID="Gen.1.17"/> God set them in the Vault of heaven to shed light upon earth, <verse eID="Gen.1.17"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.18" sID="Gen.1.18"/> to rule the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God
       saw that it was good. <verse eID="Gen.1.18"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.19" sID="Gen.1.19"/> Evening came and morning came, making the fourth day. <verse eID="Gen.1.19"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.20" sID="Gen.1.20"/>
       Then God said, <q>Let the waters teem with shoals of living crea­tures, and let birds fly over the earth under the open Vault of heaven.</q>
      <verse eID="Gen.1.20"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.21" sID="Gen.1.21"/> So God formed the great sea-monsters and every kind of living creature that moves,
       with which the waters teem, and also every kind of winged bird. God saw that it was good,
      <verse eID="Gen.1.21"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.22" sID="Gen.1.22"/> and God blessed them; <q>be fruitful,</q> he said, <q>multiply, and fill the waters
       of the sea: let the birds multiply on earth.</q> <verse eID="Gen.1.22"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.23" sID="Gen.1.23"/> Evening came and morning came, making the fifth day. <verse eID="Gen.1.23"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.24" sID="Gen.1.24"/> Then God said, <q>Let the earth
       <milestone type="pb" n="2"/>
       bring forth every kind of living creature, animals, reptiles, and wild beasts.</q> And so it was.
      <verse eID="Gen.1.24"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.25" sID="Gen.1.25"/> God made every kind of wild beast, every kind of animal, and every kind of reptile;
       and God saw that it was good. <verse eID="Gen.1.25"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.26" sID="Gen.1.26"/> Then said God, <q>Let us make man in our own likeness, to resemble us, with mastery
       over the fish in the sea, the birds of the air, the animals, every wild beast of the earth, and every rep­tile that crawls on
       earth.</q> <verse eID="Gen.1.26"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.27" sID="Gen.1.27"/> So God formed man in his own likeness, in the likeness of God he formed him, male
       and female he formed both. <verse eID="Gen.1.27"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.28" sID="Gen.1.28"/> And God blessed them; God said to them, <q>Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth
       and subdue it, mastering the fish in the sea, the birds of the air, and every living crea­ture that crawls on earth.</q> <verse eID="Gen.1.28"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.29" sID="Gen.1.29"/> God also said, <q>See, I give you every plant that bears seed all over the earth,
       and every tree with seed in its fruit; be that your food. <verse eID="Gen.1.29"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.30" sID="Gen.1.30"/> To every wild beast on earth, to every bird of the air, and to every living
       creature that crawls on earth, I give all the green growth for food.</q> And so it was. <verse eID="Gen.1.30"/>
      <verse osisID="Gen.1.31" sID="Gen.1.31"/> God saw all that he had made, and very good it was. Evening came and morning came,
       making the sixth day. <verse eID="Gen.1.31"/>

     <chapter osisId="Gen.2" sId="Gen.2"/>
      <p>
       <verse osisID="Gen.2.1" sID="Gen.2.1"/> Thus was the universe and its array all finished. <verse eId="Gen.2.1"/>
       <verse osisID="Gen.2.2" sID="Gen.2.2"/> On the seventh day God ceased his work, he desisted from working on the seventh day; <verse eId="Gen.2.2"/>
       <verse osisID="Gen.2.3" sID="Gen.2.3"/> so God blessed and consecrated the seventh day, because on it he desisted from all
        his work of creation. <verse eId="Gen.2.3"/>

        <verse osisID="Gen.2.4" sID="Gen.2.4"/> At the time when God the Eternal made earth and heaven, <verse eId="Gen.2.4"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.5" sID="Gen.2.5"/> there was as yet no shrub on earth, and no plant had sprung up; for God the
         Eternal had not sent rain on earth, and there was no one to till the soil— <verse eId="Gen.2.5"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.6" sID="Gen.2.6"/> though a mist used to rise from the earth and water all the surface of the ground. <verse eId="Gen.2.6"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.7" sID="Gen.2.7"/> Then God the Eternal moulded man from the dust of the ground, breathing into his
         nostrils the breath of life; this was how man became a living being. <verse eId="Gen.2.7"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.8" sID="Gen.2.8"/> In the land of Eden, to the far east, God the Eternal then planted a park, where
         he put the man whom he had moulded. <verse eId="Gen.2.8"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.9" sID="Gen.2.9"/> And from the ground God the Eter­nal made all sorts of trees to grow that were
         delightful to see and good to eat, with the tree of life and the tree that yields knowl­edge of good and evil in the
         cen­tre of the park. <verse eId="Gen.2.9"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.10" sID="Gen.2.10"/> From Eden a river flowed to water the park, which on leaving the park branched
         into four streams; <verse eId="Gen.2.10"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.11" sID="Gen.2.11"/> the name of the first is Pison (the one which flows all round the land of
         Havilah, where there is gold—<verse eId="Gen.2.11"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.12" sID="Gen.2.12"/> fine gold in that land—with pearls and beryls), <verse eId="Gen.2.12"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.13" sID="Gen.2.13"/> the name of the second is Gihon (the one which flows all round the land of Ethiopia), <verse eId="Gen.2.13"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.14" sID="Gen.2.14"/> the name of the third is Hiddekel (the one which flows west of Assyria), and the
         fourth river is the Eu­phrates. <verse eId="Gen.2.14"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.15" sID="Gen.2.15"/>God the Eternal took man and put him in the park of Eden, to till it and to guard it.<verse eId="Gen.2.15"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.16" sID="Gen.2.16"/> And God the Eternal laid a command upon the man: <q>You are free to eat from any
         tree in the park,</q> he said,<q> <verse eId="Gen.2.16"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.17" sID="Gen.2.17"/> but you must not eat from the tree that yields knowledge of good and evil, for
         on the day you eat from that tree you shall die.</q> <verse eId="Gen.2.17"/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.18" sID="Gen.2.18"/> Then said God the Eternal, <q>It is not good for man to be alone; I will make a
         helper to suit him.</q> <verse eId="Gen.2.18"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.19" sID="Gen.2.19"/> So from the ground God shaped every wild beast and every bird
        <milestone type="pb" n="3"/>
         of the air, bringing them to the man to see what he would call them; whatever the man called any living creature, that
         was to be its name. <verse eId="Gen.2.19"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.20" sID="Gen.2.20"/> So the man named all the animals and the birds and every wild beast, but no
         helper could be found to suit man himself. <verse eId="Gen.2.20"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.21" sID="Gen.2.21"/>Then God the Eternal made a deep sleep to fall upon the man; while he slept, he
         took one of his ribs, closing up the flesh in its place; <verse eId="Gen.2.21"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.22" sID="Gen.2.22"/> the rib he had taken from the man God the Eternal shaped into a woman, and
         brought her to the man. <verse eId="Gen.2.22"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.23" sID="Gen.2.23"/> Then said the man,
         <lg>
          <l> This, this at last, is bone of my bones, </l>
          <l> and flesh of my own flesh:</l>
          <l> this shall be called Wo-man, </l>
          <l> for from man was she taken! </l>
         </lg>
        <verse eId="Gen.2.23"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.24" sID="Gen.2.24"/> (This is why a man leaves his father and mother and cleaves to his wife, till
         they become one flesh.) <verse eId="Gen.2.24"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.2.25" sID="Gen.2.25"/> Both of them, the man and his wife, were naked, but they felt no shame. <verse eId="Gen.2.25"/>

       <p>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.1" sID="Gen.3.1"/> Now the serpent was cun­ning, more cunning than any creature that God the Eternal
         had made; he said to the woman, <q>And so God has said that you are not to eat fruit from any tree in the park?</q> <verse eId="Gen.3.1"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.2" sID="Gen.3.2"/>
         The woman said to the serpent, <q>We can eat fruit from the trees in the park,<verse eId="Gen.3.2"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.3" sID="Gen.3.3"/> but, as for the tree in the centre of the park, God has said, <q>You must not eat
        from it, you must not touch it, lest you die.</q> </q> <verse eId="Gen.3.3"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.4" sID="Gen.3.4"/> <q>No,</q> said the serpent to the woman, <q>you shall not die; <verse eId="Gen.3.4"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.5" sID="Gen.3.5"/>
         God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil.</q>
        <verse eId="Gen.3.5"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.6" sID="Gen.3.6"/> So, when the woman saw that the tree was good to eat and delight­ful to see,
         desirable to look upon, she took some of the fruit and
         <milestone type="column" n="2"/>
         ate it; she also gave some to her husband, and he ate. <verse eId="Gen.3.6"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.7" sID="Gen.3.7"/> Then the eyes of both were opened, and they realized that they were naked; so they
         stitched some fig-leaves together and made them­selves girdles. <verse eId="Gen.3.7"/>
       </p>
       <p>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.8" sID="Gen.3.8"/> In the cool of the day, when they heard the sound of God the Eternal walking in
         the park, the man and his wife hid from the presence of God the Eternal among the trees of the park; <verse eId="Gen.3.8"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.9" sID="Gen.3.9"/> but God the Eternal called to the man and asked him, <q>Where are you?</q> <verse eId="Gen.3.9"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.10" sID="Gen.3.10"/>
         <q>I heard thy sound within the park,</q>he answered, <q>and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.</q> <verse eId="Gen.3.10"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.11" sID="Gen.3.11"/>He said, <q>Who told you that you were naked? Have you been eating from the tree
         which I forbade you to eat?</q> <verse eId="Gen.3.11"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.12" sID="Gen.3.12"/> The man is said, <q>The woman thou gavest me as a companion, she gave me some
         fruit from the tree, and I ate it.</q> <verse eId="Gen.3.12"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.13" sID="Gen.3.13"/> Then God the Eternal said to the woman, <q>What is this that you have done?</q>
        The wom­an said, <q>I ate because the ser­pent beguiled me.</q> <verse eId="Gen.3.13"/>
        <verse osisID="Gen.3.14" sID="Gen.3.14"/>
         So God the Eternal said to the serpent,<q>Since you have done this,

           A curse on you of all creatures! a curse
