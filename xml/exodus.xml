      <verse sID="Exod.1.5" osisID="Exod.1.5"/> and the direct descend­ants of Jacob numbered seventy in all.
       (Joseph was in Egypt already.) <verse eID="Exod.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.1.7" osisID="Exod.1.7"/> The sons of Israel were fruitful and swarmed, they multiplied and teemed
       till the land was full of them. <verse eID="Exod.1.7"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.1.13" osisID="Exod.1.13"/> The Egyptians made slaves of the Israelites harshly; <verse eID="Exod.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.1.14" osisID="Exod.1.14"/> they made life bitter for them with hard service, forcing them to build
       with mortar and bricks and to do all manner of field-work--lot of slaves harshly treated. <verse eID="Exod.1.14"/>

       <verse sID="Exod.1.8" osisID="Exod.1.8"/> A new king rose over Egypt, who had not knowledge of Joseph; <verse eID="Exod.1.8"/>
       <verse sID="Exod.1.9" osisID="Exod.1.9"/> he said to his people, <q>Look, the Israelites are too many and too mighty
        for us! <verse eID="Exod.1.9"/>
       <verse sID="Exod.1.10" osisID="Exod.1.10"/> We must handle them carefully, lest they multi­ply and then, if we happen
        to be at war, join our enemies and fight against us, so as to escape from the country.</q><verse eID="Exod.1.10"/>
       <verse sID="Exod.1.11" osisID="Exod.1.11"/> So they put them under captains of the la­bour gangs, to crush them with
        heavy loads; and they built for the Pharaoh the store-towns of Pithom and Ramses. <verse eID="Exod.1.11"/>
       <verse sID="Exod.1.12" osisID="Exod.1.12"/> But the more they were crushed, the more they multiplied and ex­panded,
        till the Egyptians dreaded the Israelites. <verse eID="Exod.1.12"/>

      <verse sID="Exod.1.15" osisID="Exod.1.15"/>[Then the king of Egypt told the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was called
       Shiphrah and the other Puah, <verse eID="Exod.1.15"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.1.16" osisID="Exod.1.16"/> that when they attended the Hebrew women and saw them on the birth-stool
       they were to kill the child, if it was a male, and to let it live, if it was a girl. <verse eID="Exod.1.16"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.1.17" osisID="Exod.1.17"/> But the midwives reverenced God; they did not do as the king of Egypt
       ordered them, but saved the male chil­dren alive. <verse eID="Exod.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.1.18" osisID="Exod.1.18"/> Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives. <q>Why have you done
       this,</q> he asked, <q>saving the male children alive?</q> <verse eID="Exod.1.18"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.1.19" osisID="Exod.1.19"/> The midwives said to the Pharaoh, <q>Because the He­brew women are not
       like the Egyptian women; they are brisk creatures, delivered before ever a midwife reaches them!</q> <verse eID="Exod.1.19"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.1.20" osisID="Exod.1.20"/> So the people continued to multiply and teem. God prospered the midwives; <verse eID="Exod.1.20"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.1.21" osisID="Exod.1.21"/> since the midwives had reverenced God, he made them mothers of families. <verse eID="Exod.1.21"/>

      <verse sID="Exod.1.22" osisID="Exod.1.22"/>The Pharaoh then ordered all his people to throw every son born to the
       Hebrews into the Nile, but to save every girl alive. <verse eID="Exod.1.22"/>

      <verse sID="Exod.2.1" osisID="Exod.2.1"/> Now a man belonging to the house of Levi went and married a daughter of
       Levi; <verse eID="Exod.2.1"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.2.2" osisID="Exod.2.2"/> the woman conceived and bore a son, and as she saw he was a handsome boy,
       she hid him for three months. <verse eID="Exod.2.2"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.2.3" osisID="Exod.2.3"/> When she could hide him no longer, she took a creel made of papyrus reeds,
       daubed it over with bitumen and pitch, and put the child in it, laying it among the reeds at the side of the Nile. <verse eID="Exod.2.3"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.2.4" osisID="Exod.2.4"/> His sister placed herself at a distance, to see what would happen to him. <verse eID="Exod.2.4"/>

      <verse sID="Exod.2.5" osisID="Exod.2.5"/>The daughter of the Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; her maidens
       were walking along the bank, and as she saw the creel among the reeds she sent her slave-girl to fetch it. <verse eID="Exod.2.5"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.2.6" osisID="Exod.2.6"/> On opening it she saw the child--it was a boy crying! She
       <milestone type="pb" n="62"/>
       pitied him, and said, <q>This is one of the Hebrews’ children.</q> <verse eID="Exod.2.6"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.2.7" osisID="Exod.2.7"/> His sister said to the Pharaoh’s daughter, <q>Shall I go and get you a
       Hebrew nurse, to suckle the child for you?</q> <verse eID="Exod.2.7"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.2.8" osisID="Exod.2.8"/> <q>Yes,</q> said the Pharaoh’s daughter. So the girl went for the child’s
       mother, <verse eID="Exod.2.8"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.2.9" osisID="Exod.2.9"/> and the Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, <q>Take this child away and suckle
       it for me, and I will pay you your wages.</q> The woman took and suckled the child, <verse eID="Exod.2.9"/>
      <verse sID="Exod.2.10" osisID="Exod.2.10"/> and when the child grew up she brought him to the Pha­raoh’s daughter,
       who adopted him as her son; she called his name Moses (Removed), <q>for,</q> she said, <q>I removed him from the

       <verse sID="Exod.2.11" osisID="Exod.2.11"/>It was during those days that Moses, now a man, once went out to his
        fellow-countrymen. He noted the loads they had to bear. And he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his own
        country men. <verse eID="Exod.2.11"/>
       <verse sID="Exod.2.12" osisID="Exod.2.12"/> Moses looked round, there was no one to be seen; so he knocked the
        Egyptian down and hid his body in the sand. <verse eID="Exod.2.12"/>
       <verse sID="Exod.2.13" osisID="Exod.2.13"/> Next day, when he went out, there were two Hebrews quarrel­ling! Moses
        said to the man in the wrong, <q>Why are you striking a fellow-countryman?</q> <verse eID="Exod.2.13"/>
       <verse sID="Exod.2.14" osisID="Exod.2.14"/> He replied, <q>Who made you an au­thority and umpire over us? Do you mean
        to murder me as you murdered the Egyptian?</q> This made Moses afraid; he reflected that what he had done must be
        known. <verse eID="Exod.2.14"/>
       <verse sID="Exod.2.15" osisID="Exod.2.15"/> When the Pharaoh heard of it, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses escaped

       <verse sID="Exod.8.9" osisID="Exod.8.9"/> Moses said to the Pharaoh, <q>You may have the honour of saying when I

       <verse sID="Exod.8.12" osisID="Exod.8.12"/>So Moses and Aaron left the Pharaoh. Moses implored the Eternal to

      <verse sID="Exod.8.7" osisID="Exod.8.7"/> The magicians did the same, by their clever tricks, bringing frogs up
