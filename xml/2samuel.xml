     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.1" osisID="2Sam.1.1"/>After the death of Saul, when David had come back from slaying the
       Amalekites and had been for two days at Ziklag, <verse eID="2Sam.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.2" osisID="2Sam.1.2"/> on the third day a man came from Saul's camp with his clothes
       torn and earth scattered on his head. When he reached David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance. <verse eID="2Sam.1.2"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.3" osisID="2Sam.1.3"/> David said to him, <q>Where do you come from?</q> <q>I have
       escaped from the camp of Israel,</q> said he. <verse eID="2Sam.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.4" osisID="2Sam.1.4"/> Then David asked him, <q>Tell me, how did things go?</q>
       He replied, <q>The troops ran away from the fight, many of the troops have fallen, and Saul and his son
       Jonathan are also dead.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.5" osisID="2Sam.1.5"/> [[David said to the young man who told him, <q>How do you know
       that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.6" osisID="2Sam.1.6"/> And the young man who told him said, <q>I happened to be on mount
       Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear! The chariots and cavalry were close upon him. <verse eID="2Sam.1.6"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.7" osisID="2Sam.1.7"/> When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. I
       answered, <q>Here I am.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.7"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.8" osisID="2Sam.1.8"/> He said to me, <q>Who are you?</q> I said to him, <q>I am an
       Amalekite.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.8"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.9" osisID="2Sam.1.9"/> Then he said to me, <q>Stand over me and des­patch me, for it is
       dizziness that has seized me--I am quite unwounded!</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.9"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.10" osisID="2Sam.1.10"/> So I stood over him and killed him, for I was sure he could not
       live after he had fallen. I took the crown from his head and the armlet from his arm, and I have brought
       them here to my lord.</q>]] <verse eID="2Sam.1.10"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.11" osisID="2Sam.1.11"/> Then David caught his clothes and tore them; so did all the men
       with him; <verse eID="2Sam.1.11"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.12" osisID="2Sam.1.12"/> they lamented and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his
       son Jonathan and the army of Judah and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <verse eID="2Sam.1.12"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.13" osisID="2Sam.1.13"/> [[David said to the young man who told him, <q>Where do you
       come from?</q> <q>I am the son of a resident alien,</q> he said, <q>an Amalekite.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.14" osisID="2Sam.1.14"/> And David said to him, <q>Why were you not afraid to lift your
       hand to de­stroy the Eternal's anointed?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.14"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.15" osisID="2Sam.1.15"/> Then David called one of the young men and said, <q>Go up to
       him and strike him down.</q> Then he felled the Amalekite, so that he died. <verse eID="2Sam.1.15"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.16" osisID="2Sam.1.16"/> <q>Your blood be on your own head,</q> said David; <q>your own
       lips have borne witness against you, when you said, <q>I slew the Eternal’s anointed!</q></q>]] <verse eID="2Sam.1.16"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.17" osisID="2Sam.1.17"/> Then David sang this dirge over Saul and his son Jonathan <verse eID="2Sam.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.18" osisID="2Sam.1.18"/> (it is written in the Book of Heroes); he said:
       <lg>
        <l> O Judah, to your crying! </l>
        <l> O Israel, to your grief and woe! </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.18"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.19" osisID="2Sam.1.19"/>
        <l> On your battle-fields the slain are lying. </l>
        <l> and heroes, alas! fallen low. </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.19"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.20" osisID="2Sam.1.20"/>
        <l> Tell it not in Gath,</l>
        <l> proclaim it not in Ashkelon's streets,</l>
        <l> lest the daughters of the Philis­tines rejoice,</l>
        <l> lest the daughters of the uncir­cumcised exult.</l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.20"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.21" osisID="2Sam.1.21"/>
        <l> Dew never fall on you, hills of Gilboa, </l>
        <l> rain never reach you, O death's own field </l>
        <l> For there a hero dropped his shield, </l>
        <l> Saul's shield, the armour of the anointed. </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.21"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.22" osisID="2Sam.1.22"/>
        <l> From the blood of the slain, </l>
        <l> from the flesh of the mighty, </l>
        <l> never did Jonathan’s bow turn back, </l>
        <l> nor the sword of Saul unsated. </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.22"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.23" osisID="2Sam.1.23"/>
        <l> Saul and Jonathan, loved and lovely, </l>
       <milestone type="pb" n="347"/>
        <l> never divided in life or in death!-- </l>
        <l> swifter than eagles, stronger than lions! </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.23"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.24" osisID="2Sam.1.24"/>
        <l> Daughters of Israel, wail for Saul, </l>
        <l> who decked you in scarlet and jewels, </l>
        <l> who adorned your robes with gold! </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.24"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.25" osisID="2Sam.1.25"/>
        <l> Alas for heroes fallen low </l>
        <l> in the thick of the fray </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.25"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.26" osisID="2Sam.1.26"/>
        <l> Jonathan slain in the field of battle, </l>
        <l> my heart is sore for you, </l>
        <l> O Jonathan, my brother! </l>
        <l> You were my dear delight, </l>
        <l> your love for me was a wonder, </l>
        <l> far beyond a woman’s love. </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.26"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.27" osisID="2Sam.1.27"/>
        <l> Alas for heroes fallen low, </l>
        <l> for weapons that once felled the foe! </l>

    <chapter osisID="2Sam.2" sID="2Sam.2"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.1" osisID="2Sam.2.1"/>After this David asked the Eternal, <q>Shall I go up to one of the
       towns of Judah?</q> The Eternal said to him, <q>Go up.</q> Then David said, <q>Where shall I go up?</q>
       <q>To Hebron,</q> the Eternal answered. <verse eID="2Sam.2.1"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.2" osisID="2Sam.2.2"/> So David went up, along with his two wives, Ahinoam the
       Jezreelitess and Abigail who had been the wife of Nabal the Karmelite. <verse eID="2Sam.2.2"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.3" osisID="2Sam.2.3"/> David also took the men who were with him, every man and his
       household, and they stayed in the citadel of Hebron; <verse eID="2Sam.2.3"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.4" osisID="2Sam.2.4"/> then the men of Judah came and anointed David there as king over
       the house of Judah. <verse eID="2Sam.2.4"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.5" osisID="2Sam.2.5"/> When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh-gilead who had
       buried Saul, he sent messengers to the leading men of Jabesh-gilead, saying, <verse eID="2Sam.2.5"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.6" osisID="2Sam.2.6"/> <q>The Eter­nal's blessing be on you for hav­ing done this
       kindness to your lord Saul in burying him! So may the Eternal be kind and true to you! And I will be good
       to you for having done this. <verse eID="2Sam.2.6"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.7" osisID="2Sam.2.7"/> Courage then, be brave! Saul your lord is dead, but the house of
       Judah has anointed me to be their king.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.2.7"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.8" osisID="2Sam.2.8"/> Now Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, had taken
       Saul's son Ishbaal across to Mahanaim, <verse eID="2Sam.2.8"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.9" osisID="2Sam.2.9"/> where he made him king over Gilead, the Asherites, Jezreel,
       Ephraim, and Ben­jamin, in fact over all Israel. <verse eID="2Sam.2.9"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.10" osisID="2Sam.2.10"/> Only the house of Judah adhered to David. [[Ishbaal, Saul's
       son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. <verse eID="2Sam.2.10"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.11" osisID="2Sam.2.11"/> The time during which David reigned at Hebron over the house
       of Judah was seven years and six months.]] <verse eID="2Sam.2.11"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.12" osisID="2Sam.2.12"/> Then Abner the son of Ner and the adherents of Ishbaal the son
       of Saul marched from Mahanaim to Gibeon; <verse eID="2Sam.2.12"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.13" osisID="2Sam.2.13"/> Joab the son of Zerulah and David's adherents also marched out,
       and met them at the reser­voir of Gibeon. The two par­ties sat down, one on the one side of the reservoir
       and the other on the other side. <verse eID="2Sam.2.13"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.14" osisID="2Sam.2.14"/> Then Abner said to Joab, <q>Let the young men get up and have a
       fight before us.</q> <q>Very well,</q> said Joab. <verse eID="2Sam.2.14"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.15" osisID="2Sam.2.15"/> So the young men got up and were numbered off, twelve for
       Benjamin and Ishbaal the son of Saul, and twelve ad­herents of David. <verse eID="2Sam.2.15"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.16" osisID="2Sam.2.16"/> Each caught his opponent by the head and stabbed him in the
       side, so that they all dropped together. Hence the spot was called <q>The Field of Sides</q> (it is at
       Gib­eon). <verse eID="2Sam.2.16"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.17" osisID="2Sam.2.17"/> That day the fight that followed was most fierce, but Abner the
       son of Ner and the men of Israel were beaten by the adherents of David. <verse eID="2Sam.2.17"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.18" osisID="2Sam.2.18"/> Zeruiah's three sons were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.
       Asahel was swift-footed as a wild deer; <verse eID="2Sam.2.18"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.19" osisID="2Sam.2.19"/> so Asahel chased Abner, and as he ran he never turned
       <milestone type="pb" n="348"/>
       to right or left in his pursuit of Abner. <verse eID="2Sam.2.19"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.20" osisID="2Sam.2.20"/> Then Abner glanced behind him and said, <q>Is that you,
       Asahel?</q> <q>Yes,</q> he answered. <verse eID="2Sam.2.20"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.21" osisID="2Sam.2.21"/> So Abner said to him, <q>Turn to your right or to your left,
       catch one of the young men and take his spoil.</q> But Asahel would not turn aside from his chase. <verse eID="2Sam.2.21"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.22" osisID="2Sam.2.22"/> Then Abner again said to Asahel, <q>Turn aside from following
       me; why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face after that?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.2.22"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.23" osisID="2Sam.2.23"/> But he would not turn aside. So Abner gave him a backward
       stroke in the belly, the spear came out at his back, and he dropped dead on the spot. [[Everyone who came
       to the spot where Asahel had dropped dead, stopped there.l] <verse eID="2Sam.2.23"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.24" osisID="2Sam.2.24"/> Joab and Abishai pursued Ab­ner, and, as the sun was setting,
       they reached the hill of Ammah, east of the road through the open country of Gibeon, <verse eID="2Sam.2.24"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.25" osisID="2Sam.2.25"/> where the Benjamites gathered behind Abner in a solid phalanx
       drawn up on the top of the hill of Ammah. <verse eID="2Sam.2.25"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.26" osisID="2Sam.2.26"/> Abner called to Joab, <q>Is the sword to devour for ever? Do
       you not know the outcome will be bitter? How long will it be before you order the troops to give up
       pursuing their fellow-countrymen?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.2.26"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.27" osisID="2Sam.2.27"/> <q>By God’s life!</q> said Joab, <q>unless you had said the
       word, not one of the men would have stopped pursuing his fellow till morning.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.2.27"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.28" osisID="2Sam.2.28"/> Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the troops stopped; they
       pur­sued Israel no longer, they fought no more. <verse eID="2Sam.2.28"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.29" osisID="2Sam.2.29"/> All that forenoon Abner and his men made their way through the
       wady of Arabah, crossing the Jordan and pass­ing right through the ravine till they reached Mahanaim. <verse eID="2Sam.2.29"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.30" osisID="2Sam.2.30"/> As for Joab, he returned from his pursuit of Abner; when he had
       mustered all the troops, nineteen of David's adherents were missing, besides Asahel, <verse eID="2Sam.2.30"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.31" osisID="2Sam.2.31"/> whereas David's adherents had killed three hundred and sixty
       men of Benjamin and of Abner’s army. <verse eID="2Sam.2.31"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.32" osisID="2Sam.2.32"/> Asahel they lifted, and buried him in his father's grave at
       Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night, and the day dawned on them at Hebron. <verse eID="2Sam.2.32"/>
