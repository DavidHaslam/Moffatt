     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.1" osisID="2Sam.1.1"/>After the death of Saul, when David had come back from slaying the
       Amalekites and had been for two days at Ziklag, <verse eID="2Sam.1.1"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.2" osisID="2Sam.1.2"/> on the third day a man came from Saul's camp with his clothes
       torn and earth scattered on his head. When he reached David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance. <verse eID="2Sam.1.2"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.3" osisID="2Sam.1.3"/> David said to him, <q>Where do you come from?</q> <q>I have
       escaped from the camp of Israel,</q> said he. <verse eID="2Sam.1.3"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.4" osisID="2Sam.1.4"/> Then David asked him, <q>Tell me, how did things go?</q>
       He replied, <q>The troops ran away from the fight, many of the troops have fallen, and Saul and his son
       Jonathan are also dead.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.4"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.5" osisID="2Sam.1.5"/> [[David said to the young man who told him, <q>How do you know
       that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.5"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.6" osisID="2Sam.1.6"/> And the young man who told him said, <q>I happened to be on mount
       Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear! The chariots and cavalry were close upon him. <verse eID="2Sam.1.6"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.7" osisID="2Sam.1.7"/> When he looked behind him, he saw me and called to me. I
       answered, <q>Here I am.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.7"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.8" osisID="2Sam.1.8"/> He said to me, <q>Who are you?</q> I said to him, <q>I am an
       Amalekite.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.8"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.9" osisID="2Sam.1.9"/> Then he said to me, <q>Stand over me and des­patch me, for it is
       dizziness that has seized me--I am quite unwounded!</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.9"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.10" osisID="2Sam.1.10"/> So I stood over him and killed him, for I was sure he could not
       live after he had fallen. I took the crown from his head and the armlet from his arm, and I have brought
       them here to my lord.</q>]] <verse eID="2Sam.1.10"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.11" osisID="2Sam.1.11"/> Then David caught his clothes and tore them; so did all the men
       with him; <verse eID="2Sam.1.11"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.12" osisID="2Sam.1.12"/> they lamented and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his
       son Jonathan and the army of Judah and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <verse eID="2Sam.1.12"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.13" osisID="2Sam.1.13"/> [[David said to the young man who told him, <q>Where do you
       come from?</q> <q>I am the son of a resident alien,</q> he said, <q>an Amalekite.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.13"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.14" osisID="2Sam.1.14"/> And David said to him, <q>Why were you not afraid to lift your
       hand to de­stroy the Eternal's anointed?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.1.14"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.15" osisID="2Sam.1.15"/> Then David called one of the young men and said, <q>Go up to
       him and strike him down.</q> Then he felled the Amalekite, so that he died. <verse eID="2Sam.1.15"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.16" osisID="2Sam.1.16"/> <q>Your blood be on your own head,</q> said David; <q>your own
       lips have borne witness against you, when you said, <q>I slew the Eternal’s anointed!</q></q>]] <verse eID="2Sam.1.16"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.17" osisID="2Sam.1.17"/> Then David sang this dirge over Saul and his son Jonathan <verse eID="2Sam.1.17"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.18" osisID="2Sam.1.18"/> (it is written in the Book of Heroes); he said:
       <lg>
        <l> O Judah, to your crying! </l>
        <l> O Israel, to your grief and woe! </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.18"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.19" osisID="2Sam.1.19"/>
        <l> On your battle-fields the slain are lying. </l>
        <l> and heroes, alas! fallen low. </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.19"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.20" osisID="2Sam.1.20"/>
        <l> Tell it not in Gath,</l>
        <l> proclaim it not in Ashkelon's streets,</l>
        <l> lest the daughters of the Philis­tines rejoice,</l>
        <l> lest the daughters of the uncir­cumcised exult.</l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.20"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.21" osisID="2Sam.1.21"/>
        <l> Dew never fall on you, hills of Gilboa, </l>
        <l> rain never reach you, O death's own field </l>
        <l> For there a hero dropped his shield, </l>
        <l> Saul's shield, the armour of the anointed. </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.21"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.22" osisID="2Sam.1.22"/>
        <l> From the blood of the slain, </l>
        <l> from the flesh of the mighty, </l>
        <l> never did Jonathan’s bow turn back, </l>
        <l> nor the sword of Saul unsated. </l>
      <verse eID="2Sam.1.22"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.23" osisID="2Sam.1.23"/>
        <l> Saul and Jonathan, loved and lovely, </l>
       <milestone type="pb" n="347"/>
        <l> never divided in life or in death!-- </l>
        <l> swifter than eagles, stronger than lions! </l>

      <verse sID="2Sam.1.24" osisID="2Sam.1.24"/>
        <l> Daughters of Israel, wail for Saul, </l>
        <l> who decked you in scarlet and jewels, </l>

      <verse sID="2Sam.1.25" osisID="2Sam.1.25"/>
        <l> Alas for heroes fallen low </l>

      <verse eID="2Sam.1.25"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.1.26" osisID="2Sam.1.26"/>
        <l> Jonathan slain in the field of battle, </l>
        <l> my heart is sore for you, </l>
        <l> O Jonathan, my brother! </l>
        <l> You were my dear delight, </l>
        <l> your love for me was a wonder, </l>
        <l> far beyond a woman’s love. </l>

    <chapter osisID="2Sam.2" sID="2Sam.2"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.1" osisID="2Sam.2.1"/>After this David asked the Eternal, <q>Shall I go up to one of the
       towns of Judah?</q> The Eternal said to him, <q>Go up.</q> Then David said, <q>Where shall I go up?</q>
       <q>To Hebron,</q> the Eternal answered. <verse eID="2Sam.2.1"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.2" osisID="2Sam.2.2"/> So David went up, along with his two wives, Ahinoam the
       Jezreelitess and Abigail who had been the wife of Nabal the Karmelite. <verse eID="2Sam.2.2"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.3" osisID="2Sam.2.3"/> David also took the men who were with him, every man and his
       household, and they stayed in the citadel of Hebron; <verse eID="2Sam.2.3"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.4" osisID="2Sam.2.4"/> then the men of Judah came and anointed David there as king over
       the house of Judah. <verse eID="2Sam.2.4"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.5" osisID="2Sam.2.5"/> When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh-gilead who had
       buried Saul, he sent messengers to the leading men of Jabesh-gilead, saying, <verse eID="2Sam.2.5"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.6" osisID="2Sam.2.6"/> <q>The Eter­nal's blessing be on you for hav­ing done this
       kindness to your lord Saul in burying him! So may the Eternal be kind and true to you! And I will be good
       to you for having done this. <verse eID="2Sam.2.6"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.7" osisID="2Sam.2.7"/> Courage then, be brave! Saul your lord is dead, but the house of
       Judah has anointed me to be their king.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.2.7"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.8" osisID="2Sam.2.8"/> Now Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, had taken
       Saul's son Ishbaal across to Mahanaim, <verse eID="2Sam.2.8"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.9" osisID="2Sam.2.9"/> where he made him king over Gilead, the Asherites, Jezreel,
       Ephraim, and Ben­jamin, in fact over all Israel. <verse eID="2Sam.2.9"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.10" osisID="2Sam.2.10"/> Only the house of Judah adhered to David. [[Ishbaal, Saul's
       son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. <verse eID="2Sam.2.10"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.11" osisID="2Sam.2.11"/> The time during which David reigned at Hebron over the house
       of Judah was seven years and six months.]] <verse eID="2Sam.2.11"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.12" osisID="2Sam.2.12"/> Then Abner the son of Ner and the adherents of Ishbaal the son
       of Saul marched from Mahanaim to Gibeon; <verse eID="2Sam.2.12"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.13" osisID="2Sam.2.13"/> Joab the son of Zerulah and David's adherents also marched out,
       and met them at the reser­voir of Gibeon. The two par­ties sat down, one on the one side of the reservoir
       and the other on the other side. <verse eID="2Sam.2.13"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.14" osisID="2Sam.2.14"/> Then Abner said to Joab, <q>Let the young men get up and have a
       fight before us.</q> <q>Very well,</q> said Joab. <verse eID="2Sam.2.14"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.15" osisID="2Sam.2.15"/> So the young men got up and were numbered off, twelve for
       Benjamin and Ishbaal the son of Saul, and twelve ad­herents of David. <verse eID="2Sam.2.15"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.16" osisID="2Sam.2.16"/> Each caught his opponent by the head and stabbed him in the
       side, so that they all dropped together. Hence the spot was called <q>The Field of Sides</q> (it is at
       Gib­eon). <verse eID="2Sam.2.16"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.17" osisID="2Sam.2.17"/> That day the fight that followed was most fierce, but Abner the
       son of Ner and the men of Israel were beaten by the adherents of David. <verse eID="2Sam.2.17"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.18" osisID="2Sam.2.18"/> Zeruiah's three sons were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.
       Asahel was swift-footed as a wild deer; <verse eID="2Sam.2.18"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.19" osisID="2Sam.2.19"/> so Asahel chased Abner, and as he ran he never turned
       <milestone type="pb" n="348"/>
       to right or left in his pursuit of Abner. <verse eID="2Sam.2.19"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.20" osisID="2Sam.2.20"/> Then Abner glanced behind him and said, <q>Is that you,
       Asahel?</q> <q>Yes,</q> he answered. <verse eID="2Sam.2.20"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.21" osisID="2Sam.2.21"/> So Abner said to him, <q>Turn to your right or to your left,
       catch one of the young men and take his spoil.</q> But Asahel would not turn aside from his chase. <verse eID="2Sam.2.21"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.22" osisID="2Sam.2.22"/> Then Abner again said to Asahel, <q>Turn aside from following
       me; why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face after that?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.2.22"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.23" osisID="2Sam.2.23"/> But he would not turn aside. So Abner gave him a backward
       stroke in the belly, the spear came out at his back, and he dropped dead on the spot. [[Everyone who came
       to the spot where Asahel had dropped dead, stopped there.l] <verse eID="2Sam.2.23"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.24" osisID="2Sam.2.24"/> Joab and Abishai pursued Ab­ner, and, as the sun was setting,
       they reached the hill of Ammah, east of the road through the open country of Gibeon, <verse eID="2Sam.2.24"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.25" osisID="2Sam.2.25"/> where the Benjamites gathered behind Abner in a solid phalanx
       drawn up on the top of the hill of Ammah. <verse eID="2Sam.2.25"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.26" osisID="2Sam.2.26"/> Abner called to Joab, <q>Is the sword to devour for ever? Do
       you not know the outcome will be bitter? How long will it be before you order the troops to give up
       pursuing their fellow-countrymen?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.2.26"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.27" osisID="2Sam.2.27"/> <q>By God’s life!</q> said Joab, <q>unless you had said the
       word, not one of the men would have stopped pursuing his fellow till morning.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.2.27"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.28" osisID="2Sam.2.28"/> Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the troops stopped; they
       pur­sued Israel no longer, they fought no more. <verse eID="2Sam.2.28"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.29" osisID="2Sam.2.29"/> All that forenoon Abner and his men made their way through the
       wady of Arabah, crossing the Jordan and pass­ing right through the ravine till they reached Mahanaim. <verse eID="2Sam.2.29"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.30" osisID="2Sam.2.30"/> As for Joab, he returned from his pursuit of Abner; when he had
       mustered all the troops, nineteen of David's adherents were missing, besides Asahel, <verse eID="2Sam.2.30"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.31" osisID="2Sam.2.31"/> whereas David's adherents had killed three hundred and sixty
       men of Benjamin and of Abner’s army. <verse eID="2Sam.2.31"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.2.32" osisID="2Sam.2.32"/> Asahel they lifted, and buried him in his father's grave at
       Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night, and the day dawned on them at Hebron. <verse eID="2Sam.2.32"/>

    <chapter osisID="2Sam.3" sID="2Sam.3"/>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.1" osisID="2Sam.3.1"/>The war between Saul's house and David's house went on; but David
       grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker. <verse eID="2Sam.3.1"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.2" osisID="2Sam.3.2"/> Sons were born to David at Hebron: his eldest was Amnon, son of
       Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; <verse eID="2Sam.3.2"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.3" osisID="2Sam.3.3"/> his second was Chileab, son of Abigail who had been the wife of
       Nabal the Karmelite; his third was Absalom, son of Maakah, the daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur; <verse eID="2Sam.3.3"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.4" osisID="2Sam.3.4"/> his fourth was Adonijah, son of Haggith; his fifth was
       Shephatiah, son of Abital; <verse eID="2Sam.3.4"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.5" osisID="2Sam.3.5"/> and his sixth Ithream, son of Eglah . . . These were born to
       David at Hebron. <verse eID="2Sam.3.5"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.6" osisID="2Sam.3.6"/>During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David,
       Abner strengthened his position in the house of Saul. <verse eID="2Sam.3.6"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.7" osisID="2Sam.3.7"/> Thus, Saul had a concubine called Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah,
       and Abner took her. Ishbaal said to Abner, <q>Why have you gone in to my father’s con­cubine?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.3.7"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.8" osisID="2Sam.3.8"/> But Abner was furious at what Ishbaal said. <q>Am I the mere
       head of a cur?</q> he asked, <q>I with all my good service to the house of Saul your father, to his
       kinsfolk and
       <milestone type="pb" n="349"/>
       his friends, I who have saved you from the grasp of David, that you find fault with me now about a wench?
      <verse eID="2Sam.3.8"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.9" osisID="2Sam.3.9"/> God kill Abner and worse, if I do not help David to what the
       Eternal swore to give him! <verse eID="2Sam.3.9"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.10" osisID="2Sam.3.10"/> I will transfer the kingdom from Saul's house, and set up
       David's throne over Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba!</q><verse eID="2Sam.3.10"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.11" osisID="2Sam.3.11"/>Ishbaal dared not say another word to Abner; he was afraid of
       him. <verse eID="2Sam.3.11"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.12" osisID="2Sam.3.12"/> But Abner sent messen­gers to David at Hebron, saying, <q>Make
       a pact with me, and you will get my help in bringing over all Israel to your side.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.3.12"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.13" osisID="2Sam.3.13"/> <q>Very well,</q> said David, <q>I will make a pact with you.
       Only, I make one demand upon you: never appear in my presence unless you bring Saul's daughter, Michal,
       when you come to see me.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.3.13"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.14" osisID="2Sam.3.14"/> Thereupon David sent messengers to Ishbaal, Saul's son,
       saying, <q>Hand me over my wife Michal, whom I bought for a hundred Philistine foreskins.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.3.14"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.15" osisID="2Sam.3.15"/> Ishbaal sent and took her away from her husband Paltiel the
       son of Laish. <verse eID="2Sam.3.15"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.16" osisID="2Sam.3.16"/> Her husband followed her, crying all the way, as far as
       Bahurim; then Abner said to him, <q>Back you go!</q> And back he went. <verse eID="2Sam.3.16"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.17" osisID="2Sam.3.17"/> Now Abner had been in com­munication with the sheikhs of
       Israel, saying, <q>You have long wanted David as your king; <verse eID="2Sam.3.17"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.18" osisID="2Sam.3.18"/> now act! The Eternal has promised David, <q>By the hand of my
       servant David I will res­cue my people Israel from the power of the Philistines and from the power of all
       their enemies!</q></q> <verse eID="2Sam.3.18"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.19" osisID="2Sam.3.19"/> Abner also talked to the Benjamites, and then Abner went away
       to Hebron to tell David all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin had determined to do. <verse eID="2Sam.3.19"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.20" osisID="2Sam.3.20"/> When Abner came to David at Hebron, accompanied by twenty men,
       David held a feast for Ab­ner and his men. <verse eID="2Sam.3.20"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.21" osisID="2Sam.3.21"/> Abner said to David, <q>I will be off to rally all Israel
       round my lord the king, that they may make a compact with you, and that you may reign as far as you
       please.</q> So David dismissed Abner, who went off in peace. <verse eID="2Sam.3.21"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.3.22" osisID="2Sam.3.22"/> Just then the followers of David came in with Joab from a
       raid, bringing rich spoil with them. Abner was not with David at Hebron, for David had dismissed him,
       and he had gone in peace. <verse eID="2Sam.3.22"/>

       in the evening he went to his couch beside the courtiers of his lord, he did not go down to his own house. <verse eID="2Sam.11.13"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.11.14" osisID="2Sam.11.14"/> In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by Uriah. <verse eID="2Sam.11.14"/>

      <verse sID="2Sam.11.16" osisID="2Sam.11.16"/> So, in beleaguering the town, Joab put Uriah where he knew brave men were engaged. <verse eID="2Sam.11.16"/>

      <verse sID="2Sam.11.24" osisID="2Sam.11.24"/> Then the messenger said to David, <q>Because the men had made a sally and attacked us in the open;

       your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.11.24"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.11.25" osisID="2Sam.11.25"/> David said to the messenger, <q>Tell Joab, <q>Let not this vex you; the sword slays one as well as

      <verse sID="2Sam.11.26" osisID="2Sam.11.26"/> When Uriah's wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she wailed for her husband; <verse eID="2Sam.11.26"/>

      <verse sID="2Sam.14.20" osisID="2Sam.14.20"/> It was to change the position of affairs that your servant Joab acted thus. My lord the king is

      <verse sID="2Sam.16.7" osisID="2Sam.16.7"/> As he cursed he shouted, <q>Begone, begone, you bloody rascal! <verse eID="2Sam.16.7"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.16.8" osisID="2Sam.16.8"/> The Eternal has avenged all the blood of Saul's house on you!--Saul, in place of whom you reigned!

     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.16.9" osisID="2Sam.16.9"/> Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, <q>Why is this cur to curse my lord the king? Let me

      <verse sID="2Sam.16.10" osisID="2Sam.16.10"/> But the king said, <q>You sons of Zeruiah, what have you and I in common? Let him curse; if the

      <verse sID="2Sam.16.11" osisID="2Sam.16.11"/> And David said to Abishai and all his officers, <q>Look at my own son, born of my body! If he is
       seeking my life, how much more may this Benjamite! Let him alone, let him curse away! The Eternal has told him to! <verse eID="2Sam.16.11"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.16.12" osisID="2Sam.16.12"/> Perhaps the Eternal may look upon my grief and repay me with kindness for this cursing of me

      <verse sID="2Sam.16.13" osisID="2Sam.16.13"/> So David and his men went along the road, while Shimei kept up with him along the side of the hill,

      <verse sID="2Sam.16.17" osisID="2Sam.16.17"/><q>Is this the affection you have for your friend?</q> said Absalom to Hushai. <q>Why did you not

      <verse sID="2Sam.16.18" osisID="2Sam.16.18"/><q>No, no,</q> said Hushai to Absalom, <q>I am for the man whom the Eternal and this people and all

     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.16.20" osisID="2Sam.16.20"/> Absalom then said to Ahithophel, <q>Give us your advice about what we should do.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.16.20"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.16.21" osisID="2Sam.16.21"/> Ahithophel said to Absalom, <q>Go in to your father's concubines whom he left to look after the

      <verse sID="2Sam.17.9" osisID="2Sam.17.9"/> he will have hid himself by this time in a cave or somewhere else. When he attacks your troops and

     <p>

     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.1" osisID="2Sam.19.1"/>Now Joab was told that the king was lamenting and weeping for Absalom. <verse eID="2Sam.19.1"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.2" osisID="2Sam.19.2"/> Indeed, the victory that day was turned into mourning, for when all the troops heard that the king
       was bewailing his son, <verse eID="2Sam.19.2"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.3" osisID="2Sam.19.3"/> the troops stole into the town like soldiers ashamed of having run away in a battle, <verse eID="2Sam.19.3"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.4" osisID="2Sam.19.4"/> while the king kept his face shrouded and cried aloud, <q>O my son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my
       son!</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.4"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.5" osisID="2Sam.19.5"/> So Joab went to the king in the palace and said, <q>You have disgraced to-day all the troops who
       saved your own life and the lives of your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your concubines--<verse eID="2Sam.19.5"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.6" osisID="2Sam.19.6"/> you with your love for your enemies and your hatred for those who love you! You have made it clear
       to-day that officers and soldiers are nothing to you! I see plainly that if Absalom were alive to-day and we were all dead, you would be quite
       satisfied! <verse eID="2Sam.19.6"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.7" osisID="2Sam.19.7"/> Come, get up and go out, to reassure your troops. I swear by the Eternal that if you do not, you will
       not have a man left on your side to­night. And that will be worse for you than all the evil that has befallen you from your youth till now.</q>
      <verse eID="2Sam.19.7"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.8" osisID="2Sam.19.8"/> So the king got up and seated himself in the gateway; and when all the troops heard that the king
       was sitting in the gateway, all the troops came into the king's presence. <verse eID="2Sam.19.8"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.9" osisID="2Sam.19.9"/> As for Israel, every man had scurried home; all over the clans of Israel there was grumbling, for
       everyone said, <q>The king rescued us from the power of our enemies, he saved us from the power of the Philistines, and now he has left the
       country in order to shake himself clear of Absalom! <verse eID="2Sam.19.9"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.10" osisID="2Sam.19.10"/> And Absalom, whom we anointed to reign over us, has died in battle. Why delay, then, to bring the
       king back?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.10"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.11" osisID="2Sam.19.11"/> This talk of all the Israelites reached the king. So king David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar the
       priests.<q><verse eID="2Sam.19.11"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.12" osisID="2Sam.19.12"/> Ask the sheikhs of Judah, <q>Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.12"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.13" osisID="2Sam.19.13"/> And tell Amasa, <q>Are you not my own bone and flesh? God kill me and worse, if you are not
       commander of my army ever after this, in place of Joab!</q></q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.13"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.14" osisID="2Sam.19.14"/> Then Amasa swayed the hearts of all the men of Judah like one man, till they sent this message to
       the king, <q>Come back, with all your fol­lowers.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.14"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.15" osisID="2Sam.19.15"/> The king came back; he reached the Jordan, and Judah went to Gilgal to meet the king and escort him
       across the Jordan. <verse eID="2Sam.19.15"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.16" osisID="2Sam.19.16"/> Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, also hurried down with the men of Judah to meet
       the king, <verse eID="2Sam.19.16"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.17" osisID="2Sam.19.17"/> accompanied by a thousand men of Benjamin. (Ziba the retainer of the house of Saul, with his
       fifteen sons and twenty servants, had dashed down to the Jordan before the king, and crossed the ford <verse eID="2Sam.19.17"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.18" osisID="2Sam.19.18"/> to bring over the king's household and do whatever the king wished.) And as the king was about to
       cross the Jordan, Shimei fell before him and said to the king, <verse eID="2Sam.19.18"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.19" osisID="2Sam.19.19"/> <q>Let not my lord hold me guilty; do not remember what your servant said so wrongly, the day my
       lord the king left Jerusalem; let not the king bear it in mind. <verse eID="2Sam.19.19"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.20" osisID="2Sam.19.20"/> Your servant knows that he sinned; so here I have come down to-day, the first of all the
       <milestone type="pb" n="371"/>
       house of Joseph, to welcome my lord the king.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.20"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.21" osisID="2Sam.19.21"/> Abishai the son of Zeruiah retorted, <q>Is not Shimei to be put to death for cursing the Eternal's
       own anointed?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.21"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.22" osisID="2Sam.19.22"/> But David said, <q>You sons of Zeruiah, what have you and I in common? Will you thwart me this day?
       Shall anyone be put to death in Israel to-day? Do you not know I have royal power this day in Israel?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.22"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.23" osisID="2Sam.19.23"/> Then the king said to Shimei, <q>You shall not die</q>; the king swore it to him. <verse eID="2Sam.19.23"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.24" osisID="2Sam.19.24"/> Saul's grandson Mephibosheth also went down to welcome the king; from the day the king left to the
       day he came back in safety, Mephibosheth had neither pared his toe-nails nor trimmed his moustache nor washed his clothes. <verse eID="2Sam.19.24"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.25" osisID="2Sam.19.25"/> When he came to Jerusalem to welcome the king, the king asked him, <q>Why did you not leave along
       with me, Mephibosheth?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.25"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.26" osisID="2Sam.19.26"/> <q>My lord king,</q> he replied, <q>my servant played me false; your servant did tell him to saddle
       an ass for me to ride off with the king--for your servant is lame. <verse eID="2Sam.19.26"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.27" osisID="2Sam.19.27"/> He slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king is like God's own angel; do as
       you think right, <verse eID="2Sam.19.27"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.28" osisID="2Sam.19.28"/> for though all my father's household deserved no more than death at my lord the king's hands, you
       put your servant among those who had a place at your own table. What further right have I to appeal to the king?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.28"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.29" osisID="2Sam.19.29"/> <q>Why will you talk on?</q> said the king; <q>I have decided that you and Ziba are to divide the
       property.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.29"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.30" osisID="2Sam.19.30"/> <q>Rather let him have it all,</q> said Mephibosheth to the king, <q>since my lord the king has
       come back in safety!</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.30"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.31" osisID="2Sam.19.31"/> Then Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Roglim and went with the king to escort him as far as
       the Jordan. <verse eID="2Sam.19.31"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.32" osisID="2Sam.19.32"/> Barzillai was a very aged man, eighty years old; he had supplied the king with food while he lay
       at Mahanaim, for Barzillai was a very wealthy man. <verse eID="2Sam.19.32"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.33" osisID="2Sam.19.33"/> So the king said to Barzillai, <q>Cross with me and I will provide for your old age in Jerusalem
       at my side.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.33"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.34" osisID="2Sam.19.34"/> But Barzillai said to the king, <q>How many years have I to live, that I should go up with the king
       to Jerusalem? <verse eID="2Sam.19.34"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.35" osisID="2Sam.19.35"/> I am now eighty years old. Have I a taste for pleasures? Can your servant taste what he eats and
       drinks? Can I still hear the voice of singing men and women? Why, then, should your servant be a burden to my lord the king? <verse eID="2Sam.19.35"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.36" osisID="2Sam.19.36"/> Your servant only meant to go a little distance with the king. Why should the king offer me this
       reward? <verse eID="2Sam.19.36"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.37" osisID="2Sam.19.37"/> Pray let your servant return, that I may die in my own town, near the grave of my father and
       mother. But here is your serv­ant Kimham! Let him cross along with the king, and treat him as you think right.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.37"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.38" osisID="2Sam.19.38"/> The king answered, <q>Kimham shall cross along with me, and I will treat him as you think right;
       whatever demand you make upon me, I will do it for you.</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.38"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.39" osisID="2Sam.19.39"/> Then all the troops went across the Jordan, but the king stood still; the king kissed Barzillai
       and bade him goodbye. <verse eID="2Sam.19.39"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.40" osisID="2Sam.19.40"/> Then the king passed over the Jordan to Gilgal, accompanied by Kimham. All the people of Judah
       marched with the king, and half the people of Israel. <verse eID="2Sam.19.40"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.41" osisID="2Sam.19.41"/> Then the men of Israel all went and said to the king, <q>Why have our kinsmen, the men of Judah,
       appropriated you? Why have
       <milestone type="pb" n="372"/>
       they brought the king and his household over the Jordan, when all David's men are his people?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.41"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.42" osisID="2Sam.19.42"/> The men of Judah all retorted to the men of Israel, <q>Because the king is near of kin to us. Why
       should you be angry over this? Have we been feeding off the king's table? Have we seized anything for ourselves?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.42"/>
      <verse sID="2Sam.19.43" osisID="2Sam.19.43"/> The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, <q>We have ten shares in the kingdom, and we, not you,
       are the oldest. Why have you disparaged us? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back the king?</q> <verse eID="2Sam.19.43"/>
