      <verse sID="Num.3.32" osisID="Num.3.32"/> Eleazar the son of Aaron was to have authority over the Levitical

      <verse sID="Num.3.34" osisID="Num.3.34"/> of these Merari clans there were counted six thousand two hun­dred

      <verse sID="Num.3.39" osisID="Num.3.39"/> The total number of Levites counted by Moses at the bidding of the

      <verse sID="Num.3.42" osisID="Num.3.42"/> Moses did as the Eternal ordered him, numbering all the eldest of the

      <verse sID="Num.3.43" osisID="Num.3.43"/> and all the eldest males, over a month old, counted one by one,
       amounted to twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three. <verse eID="Num.3.43"/>

     <p>

      <verse sID="Num.3.47" osisID="Num.3.47"/> you must pay twelve shillings a head for them (reckoning by the sa­cred

      <verse sID="Num.3.49" osisID="Num.3.49"/> So Moses took the redemption-money from these extra men, over and

      <verse sID="Num.4.5" osisID="Num.4.5"/> When the camp started on the march, Aaron and his sons were to enter the

      <verse sID="Num.4.6" osisID="Num.4.6"/> wrapping a leather sheet over it, laying a violet pall on the top, and

      <verse sID="Num.4.8" osisID="Num.4.8"/> laying a scarlet pall on the top, and wrapping a leather sheet over it,

      <verse sID="Num.4.11" osisID="Num.4.11"/> They were to lay a violet pall over the golden altar, covering it with

      <verse sID="Num.4.12" osisID="Num.4.12"/> also they were to wrap up all the sacerdotal utensils in a violet pall,

      <verse sID="Num.4.15" osisID="Num.4.15"/> Once Aaron and his sons had finished cover­ing up the sanctuary and all
       its contents, then, as the camp marched forward, the Kohathites were to come forward and carry the load--but
       without touching the sacred objects themselves; that would be fatal to them. Such were the duties of the

      <verse sID="Num.4.17" osisID="Num.4.17"/> The Eternal told Moses and Aaron <verse eID="Num.4.17"/>

      <verse sID="Num.4.19" osisID="Num.4.19"/> in order that they might live, and not die, in han­dling the sacred

      <verse sID="Num.4.20" osisID="Num.4.20"/> but the Kohathites, in discharging all their appointed tasks and

     <p>
      <verse sID="Num.9.6" osisID="Num.9.6"/>Some, however, could not keep the passover on that day, as they had been
