      <verse sID="Num.3.32" osisID="Num.3.32"/> Eleazar the son of Aaron was to have authority over the Levitical

      <verse sID="Num.3.34" osisID="Num.3.34"/> of these Merari clans there were counted six thousand two hun­dred

      <verse sID="Num.3.39" osisID="Num.3.39"/> The total number of Levites counted by Moses at the bidding of the

      <verse sID="Num.3.42" osisID="Num.3.42"/> Moses did as the Eternal ordered him, numbering all the eldest of the

      <verse sID="Num.3.43" osisID="Num.3.43"/> and all the eldest males, over a month old, counted one by one,
       amounted to twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three. <verse eID="Num.3.43"/>

     <p>

      <verse sID="Num.3.47" osisID="Num.3.47"/> you must pay twelve shillings a head for them (reckoning by the sa­cred

      <verse sID="Num.3.49" osisID="Num.3.49"/> So Moses took the redemption-money from these extra men, over and

      <verse sID="Num.4.5" osisID="Num.4.5"/> When the camp started on the march, Aaron and his sons were to enter the

      <verse sID="Num.4.6" osisID="Num.4.6"/> wrapping a leather sheet over it, laying a violet pall on the top, and

      <verse sID="Num.4.8" osisID="Num.4.8"/> laying a scarlet pall on the top, and wrapping a leather sheet over it,

      <verse sID="Num.4.11" osisID="Num.4.11"/> They were to lay a violet pall over the golden altar, covering it with

      <verse sID="Num.4.12" osisID="Num.4.12"/> also they were to wrap up all the sacerdotal utensils in a violet pall,

      <verse sID="Num.4.15" osisID="Num.4.15"/> Once Aaron and his sons had finished cover­ing up the sanctuary and all
       its contents, then, as the camp marched forward, the Kohathites were to come forward and carry the load--but
       without touching the sacred objects themselves; that would be fatal to them. Such were the duties of the

      <verse sID="Num.4.17" osisID="Num.4.17"/> The Eternal told Moses and Aaron <verse eID="Num.4.17"/>

      <verse sID="Num.4.19" osisID="Num.4.19"/> in order that they might live, and not die, in han­dling the sacred

      <verse sID="Num.4.20" osisID="Num.4.20"/> but the Kohathites, in discharging all their appointed tasks and

      <verse sID="Num.7.1" osisID="Num.7.1"/>Now on the day when Moses finished the erection of the Dwelling, anointing it and con­secrating it, and also anointing and consecrating all its belong­ings and the altar with all its 2 belongings, the chieftains of Israel who were heads of fam­ilies (that is, the leaders of the clans, at the head of the men who had been registered) 3 brought their offerings before the Eternal, six large waggons and twelve oxen, a waggon for every two chieftains and one ox for every chieftain; these they presented in front of the Dwell- 4 ing, and the Eternal told Moses S to accept the gift from them, that the waggons might serve for moving the Trysting tent; he was to hand them over to the Levites, as they required them for their special duties.
6 So Moses accepted the wag­gons and the oxen and handed 7 them over to the Levites: two waggons and four oxen he handed over to the Gershonites 8 for their work, and four waggons with eight oxen he handed over to the Merarites for the work they had to do under the super­vision of Ithamar the son of o Aaron the priest. To the Ko- hathites he gave nothing, for they were in charge of sacred ob­jects which they had to carry on their shoulders.
10 On the day that the altar was anointed the chieftains also
brought their dedication gift, presenting their offerings before the altar; whereupon the Eter- 11 nal told Moses that the chief­tains were to present their offer­ings one after another, day by day, for the dedication of the altar. He who offered on 12 the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, belonging to the clan of Judah, and his offer- 13 ing was a silver dish weighing about five pounds, a silver bowl weighing nearly three pounds (on the sacred scale of weights), both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil as a cereal-offering, a 14 golden saucer weighing nearly five ounces, full of incense, a 15 young bullock, a ram, and a yearling male lamb as a burnt- offering, a he-goat as a sin- 16 offering, and, by way of sacrifice 17 for a recompense-offering, two oxen, five rams, five he-goats and five yearling male lambs.
