      <verse sID="Num.3.32" osisID="Num.3.32"/> Eleazar the son of Aaron was to have authority over the Levitical

      <verse sID="Num.3.34" osisID="Num.3.34"/> of these Merari clans there were counted six thousand two hun­dred

      <verse sID="Num.3.39" osisID="Num.3.39"/> The total number of Levites counted by Moses at the bidding of the

      <verse sID="Num.3.42" osisID="Num.3.42"/> Moses did as the Eternal ordered him, numbering all the eldest of the

      <verse sID="Num.3.43" osisID="Num.3.43"/> and all the eldest males, over a month old, counted one by one,
       amounted to twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three. <verse eID="Num.3.43"/>

     <p>

      <verse sID="Num.3.47" osisID="Num.3.47"/> you must pay twelve shillings a head for them (reckoning by the sa­cred

      <verse sID="Num.3.49" osisID="Num.3.49"/> So Moses took the redemption-money from these extra men, over and

      <verse sID="Num.4.5" osisID="Num.4.5"/> When the camp started on the march, Aaron and his sons were to enter the

      <verse sID="Num.4.6" osisID="Num.4.6"/> wrapping a leather sheet over it, laying a violet pall on the top, and

      <verse sID="Num.4.8" osisID="Num.4.8"/> laying a scarlet pall on the top, and wrapping a leather sheet over it,

      <verse sID="Num.4.11" osisID="Num.4.11"/> They were to lay a violet pall over the golden altar, covering it with

      <verse sID="Num.4.12" osisID="Num.4.12"/> also they were to wrap up all the sacerdotal utensils in a violet pall,

      <verse sID="Num.4.15" osisID="Num.4.15"/> Once Aaron and his sons had finished cover­ing up the sanctuary and all
       its contents, then, as the camp marched forward, the Kohathites were to come forward and carry the load--but
       without touching the sacred objects themselves; that would be fatal to them. Such were the duties of the

      <verse sID="Num.4.17" osisID="Num.4.17"/> The Eternal told Moses and Aaron <verse eID="Num.4.17"/>

      <verse sID="Num.4.19" osisID="Num.4.19"/> in order that they might live, and not die, in han­dling the sacred

      <verse sID="Num.4.20" osisID="Num.4.20"/> but the Kohathites, in discharging all their appointed tasks and

      <verse sID="Num.7.84" osisID="Num.7.84"/> Such were the gifts presented by the chieftains of Israel at the

      <verse sID="Num.7.89" osisID="Num.7.89"/>... And when Moses en­tered the Trysting tent to talk with Him, he heard

      <verse sID="Num.8.1" osisID="Num.8.1"/>The Eternal gave Moses this order <verse eID="Num.8.1"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.2" osisID="Num.8.2"/> for Aaron, that when he hung up the lamps, the seven lamps were to
       light up the wall opposite the lampstand. <verse eID="Num.8.2"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.3" osisID="Num.8.3"/> Aaron saw to this: he hung up the lamps in front of the lampstand, as
       the Eternal had told Moses. <verse eID="Num.8.3"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.4" osisID="Num.8.4"/> (The lampstand was wrought in beaten gold, from base to branches--beaten

      <verse sID="Num.8.5" osisID="Num.8.5"/>The Eternal said to Moses, <verse eID="Num.8.5"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.6" osisID="Num.8.6"/> <q>Set aside the Levites in Israel and cleanse them; <verse eID="Num.8.6"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.7" osisID="Num.8.7"/> cleanse them thus. Sprinkle them with water, to purify them; have all
       their bodies shaved, and make them wash their clothes and be clean. <verse eID="Num.8.7"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.8" osisID="Num.8.8"/> Then let them take a young bullock and the usual cereal-­offering, some
       fine flour mixed with oil, while you take another young bullock as a sin-offering; <verse eID="Num.8.8"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.9" osisID="Num.8.9"/> bring the Levites in front of the Trysting tent, where you must
       convene the whole community of Israel, <verse eID="Num.8.9"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.10" osisID="Num.8.10"/> presenting the Levites before the Eternal; whereupon the Israelites
       shall lay their hands upon the Levites, <verse eID="Num.8.10"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.11" osisID="Num.8.11"/> and Aaron shall formally make them over to the Eternal as Israelites
       who are to do the Eternal’s work. <verse eID="Num.8.11"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.12" osisID="Num.8.12"/> The Levites shall lay their hands on the bullocks, and you must
       sacrifice them to the Eternal as expiation for the Le­vites, one as a sin-offering, the other as a
       burnt-offering. <verse eID="Num.8.12"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.13" osisID="Num.8.13"/> You shall place the Levites before Aaron and his sons, making them
       over formally to the Eter­nal, <verse eID="Num.8.13"/>
      <verse sID="Num.8.14" osisID="Num.8.14"/> and singling out the Levites from Israel to belong to me.</q><verse eID="Num.8.14"/>

     <p>
      <verse sID="Num.8.15" osisID="Num.8.15"/><q>Then the Levites can enter upon their duties in the Trysting tent,

      <verse sID="Num.8.20" osisID="Num.8.20"/>So Moses and Aaron and all the community of Israel did exactly as the

      <verse sID="Num.8.21" osisID="Num.8.21"/> the Levites purged themselves from sin and washed their clothes,

      <verse sID="Num.8.26" osisID="Num.8.26"/> he may help his fellows to look after things within the Trysting tent,
